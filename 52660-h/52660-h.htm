<p class='pindent'>I have been asked by the author to say a word by
way of introduction to this very interesting record
of conversations and inquiries. On the whole, I feel
my word to be superfluous; for the book speaks for
itself, and every reader will form his own opinion.
But since the author has asked for my co-operation, I
gladly offer what little I can.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am a teacher of philosophy at a university. For
the most part my own courses are technical in character.
Some of my work is with graduate students.
I am accustomed to discuss controverted opinions
with people who regard philosophy from a skeptical
and more or less controversial, and almost always
highly critical, point of view. Hence, my own first
impression of the work of the “Seekers” and of the
leader of their always pleasing inquiries, was mingled
with a certain wonder as to the possibility of their
accomplishing together, as well as they have done,
what they undertook. This wonder has changed, as I
have become better acquainted with them, into a
delight that the tact, the caution, the tolerance and
the earnestness of the leader, and the skill and docility
of the pupils, could result in setting before us so
fine a model of teaching and of learning as here
appears. The book is one to encourage every lover
of good things, and everyone who wants to see how
the minds of young people in this country, and living
under good conditions, can be turned toward great
questions in such a way as to encourage sincerity,
thoughtfulness and the beginnings of true wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In what little I have to say of this book I ought
of course to abstract altogether from such agreement
as I indeed feel with the form of Idealism which
Miss Sampter represents. The question put to me is
the question whether the method of procedure here
adopted is one that promises to be genuinely useful
as an initiation of young people into the study of
deeper questions. I answer that the author seems to
have made out her case, and to have proved her
faith in her method by her work. The age and
the previous training of the “Seekers”—as they are
sketched in the author’s preliminary statement—once
presupposed, this mode of procedure could only prove
a help to them. The methods used are an important
beginning. If any of the “Seekers” go on to a more
advanced study of philosophy, in college or elsewhere,
they ought to prove apt learners. If they simply
turn to life as their further teacher, they should be
ready to profit by some of its deepest lessons better
than they could otherwise have done. If, upon further
inquiry, they incline to other opinions about
the world and about life than the ones they have
emphasized, they will still always remain more
tolerant of the varieties of opinion, and more hopeful
of the right and the power of the human mind to
grapple with grave issues, than they would otherwise
have been. These hours of “seeking” will have
opened their eyes to values which are indeed permanent,
whatever will be the true solution of the problems
of philosophy; and the memory of these hours
will prove henceforth a safeguard against cynicism
when they doubt, and against intolerance and inhumanity
when they believe. And, whatever the truth
may be, about God, or about the world, or about life,
cynicism in doubt, and intolerance and inhumanity in
belief, are great evils, against which the young people
of our time need to be guarded quite as much as men
needed to be guarded against such evils in the days
either of the Sophists or of the Inquisitors. For, in
one guise or another, speaking the language of old or
of new faith or unfaith, Sophists and Inquisitors we
have always with us, either corrupting or oppressing
the youth. The methods of our author, as set
forth in this book, make for liberty together with
seriousness, for self-expression together with reverence,
for thoughtfulness together with a sense of
deeper values. And in so far the book is a success as
a model of the way in which our new problems must
be met when we have to deal with the young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If one undertakes to consider such topics with a
class as youthful and at the same time as enlightened
as the “Seekers,” the dilemma is obvious. One must
indeed be more or less dogmatic in tone about at
least some central interest; one must make use of the
persuasive power of a teacher’s personal influence; or
else one will lead to no definite results. On the other
hand, if one propounds one’s dogmas merely as the
traditional teacher of religion has always done by
saying: “This is our faith. This is what you should
believe,”—one is then in no case teaching philosophy,
and one is hardly helping the young people to “seek.”
Moreover, such mere dogmas, addressed to young
people in whom the period of “enlightenment” has
already begun, will tend to awaken in their minds new
doubts and objections, rather than to convey to them
the positive truth, even if one’s own dogmas happen
to be true. Hence arises a problem of instruction
which cannot be solved in the case of these “Seekers”
as we teachers of philosophy often try nowadays to
solve our analogous problems in dealing with older
pupils in college. Some of us meet our own problems
with the older students by directly disclaiming all
authority to control their convictions, by asking them
to become as self-critical and independent as they
can, and by stating our own opinions with the intent
<span class='it'>not</span> to make disciples, but to enable our students to
form their own personal judgments through the very
sympathy with our efforts to be reflective, self-critical
and constructive. Thus we do not try to convey a
faith so much as to help our students to their own
spiritual independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In strong opposition to our mode of procedure,
many popular teachers of this or that form of “New
Thought” have been trying of late to annul modern
doubts, and to lead men to a higher spiritual insight
by means of certain “intuitions,” for the sake of which
skeptical inquiry, stern criticism, elaborate reflection
must be laid aside; so that the kindly disposed
learner, even if he indeed is not to be a believer in
certain old-fashioned creeds, still looks to his teacher
for a means of quieting his doubts, and so that what
is supposed to be “philosophy” becomes a sort of
“anæsthetic revelation,” with the teacher as the assistant
who administers the anæsthetic whereby the pupil
is prepared for the surgery of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, whatever may be the use of such “New
Thought” for invalid wrecks, or even for more or
less world-weary lovers of the good, whom sad experience
has turned away from their earlier religious
creeds, and who need to be restored to their courage
in facing reality;—still, these anæsthetic methods of
the lovers of the “silence” and of the vague light,
are <span class='it'>not</span> suited to the best needs of the enlightened
young people, such as these “Seekers” who are about
to begin life, who know their little fragments of
science, of socialism, and of modern problems, and
who want unity with clearness. Nor are such young
people at just this age yet ready for our more technical
academic procedure. Shall they be left then
unguided, until their interest in unifying life has been
lost in the confusion and variety of their increasing
knowledge, until their youthful idealism has been saddened
and perhaps soiled by the world, and until
their criticism of life has become at once tragic and
cynical?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Sampter has undertaken to answer these
questions by dealing with the need of just such people.
She does so with a genuine clearness of vision, with
a careful touch that helps and with a spirit which
prepares them to meet their problems, and not to lose
unity by reason of the complexities of their situation.
She dogmatizes a little, to be sure; and in fact she
repeats some of her dogmas not infrequently, without
giving any elaborate reasons for these dogmas. They
are the dogmas of a metaphysical idealism which I
myself in the main accept, but which no direct intuition
can very adequately justify, while their technical
justification could not possibly be discussed at length
in the meetings of the “Seekers.” On the other
hand, our author is no mere partisan of intuition.
Her dogmas are stated in forms that not only win her
“plastic youth” to agreement, but challenge them to
a reflection which ere long, in some of them, will
lead to new interpretations, to doubts, and so, in time,
to a higher insight than they at first gain. She sets
her pupils to thinking as well as to receiving; they
become inquirers rather than passive recipients of
an intuition. They are thus prepared for a variety
of future religious and philosophical experiences, and
yet they are kept in touch with that love and hope of
unity which alone can justify the existence of our very
doubts, of our philosophical disputes, and of our
modern complications of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a means of avoiding both of the opposing
extremes sketched in the foregoing account of the
ways of teaching philosophical opinions, as a <span class='it'>via
media</span> in the work of beginning the philosophical
instruction of young people, as a preparation for
more critical study, as a conservation of some of the
best in the spirit of faith without an undue appeal
to mere intuition, and as a model of what can be done
to awaken a very notable type of young inquirers such
as our modern training tends to produce in the homes
of very many of us—this book is, in my opinion, to
be very heartily commended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The educational problem with which it deals concerns
meanwhile a very deep and intensely practical
interest of our American civilization. We cannot
retain the unity of our national consciousness unless
we can keep, even in the midst of all the complications
and doubts of the modern world, our sense of the
great common values of the spiritual world. Without
philosophy, our nation can therefore never come
to its own. Philosophy does not mean the acceptance
of any mere authority. And it will not lead us to
universal agreement about any one form of creed.
But it will teach us to unite freedom, tolerance, insight,
and spirituality. Without these, of what worth
would be mere bulk and mere wealth to our nation?
I welcome this book then because our author has contributed
to one of the most important of the tasks of
our time—the task of helping our nation to regain
the now much confused and endangered consciousness
of its own unity.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'><a id='begin'></a>THE BEGINNING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a live book. It was lived first, and written
only afterwards. So it can lay no claim to the title
of art, which is experience remoulded in the cast of
individual genius; for this was not at all moulded,
save as the written word reshapes the spoken. It is
a philosophic adventure, an experiment, written down
by one, but lived by seven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why did I write it down? may be asked. Every
new book needs an excuse for being. I wrote it down
because it seemed an answer, perhaps a partial, but
still a living answer, to two questions that cry aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I look about me, and observe the doings and
thoughts of men and women in this active time, I
notice two problems, related one to the other, and
wanting but one solution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of these is a lack of common purpose in the
works of life. Many religions are there, many creeds
and anti-creeds, many purposes, from petty, selfish
gain to reforms in government and social service.
Scientist, politician, artist, philanthropist and minister
go each toward a partial goal, in opposition to
one another, with no one purpose, no end beyond all
lesser ends, no larger patriotism. Morals are either
very stiff or very lax, without any conscious reason
for either their stiffness or their laxity. The only
reason for moral conviction, the only purpose that
could unite all purposes, the only patriotism to hold
all men together and give the union needful for great
and strong achievement, is a common faith in the
goal and meaning of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second problem is a more conscious one, the
problem of moral and religious education for our
children. For ourselves—so think many among us—we
do not need a philosophy or religion; we are good
enough without having any reason for being good.
But we think our children need some instruction and
guidance, something to satisfy the blessed cravings
and doubts that we have long since killed within ourselves.
For barely one among us fails to remember
his fifteen-year-old questionings and strivings, and his
defeat, when at last he decided to think no more,
because his problem was insoluble. But even these
who are so well contented with their own hard-won
torpor want something better for their children. The
question is asked again and again: “Shall we teach
our children what we do not believe? And can we
teach them what we do believe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this book I attempt to solve both problems at
once, and through the children to speak to their
parents. For many who will not admit the least interest
in the vital questions that have created every
religion and philosophy throughout time, still are
interested and will listen when the problem touches
their own children. And only through the creative,
open and daring mind of youth, not yet either stiffened
or broken, can the spirit of a larger and a
richer faith give new inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am convinced that to-day all thoughtful men believe
the same, where vital questions arise, and that
each man sees a different angle of the same truth,
which grows and grows in our vision, with the growing
knowledge of man. All our ministers with their
different churches, and our congregations with their
sectarian prejudices, have at heart a common goal, a
faith that needs only to be spoken to be believed.
Let their children draw them together. Find a common
religion to be taught in the school—where this
necessity is the present problem of all educators, and
where so far ethical courses and emasculated Christianity
have given no solution—and from that larger
patriotism of a common faith in childhood will spring
the faith bigger than ethics and philanthropics, big
enough to include all churches and systems in an
unseen brotherhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were I able to carry out this idea in a school, I
would have classes or clubs, such as the Seekers, for
all girls and boys of about the third or fourth high-school
year. Then, for the younger children as well
as for the older ones, I would have songs and readings
at the assembly, which would suggest or picture
forth the inmost spirit of our modern faith. These
songs and readings I would let the older pupils choose
and discuss in their clubs; and I would leave in their
hands, as much as possible, the social and spiritual
regulation of the school life. Faith and action go
together. Each without the other is barren.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My purpose in this book is then twofold: to record
how such clubs and classes work in practice, and
thereby suggest a method from experience; also to
give, in such large and perhaps superficial aspect as
the means necessitate, the main outline of my thought.
Not mine alone, but yours and every man’s. I bring
no news; but only an old, forgotten story, new and
strange to our widened knowledge. Accept its large
intent, if you reject its lesser achievement; admit that
this is the only possible truth in the light of our
present knowledge. Though you believe more than
this, accept at least the Seekers’ path as pointing toward
the goal. To these children it gave a way and
a light; it satisfied a need and answered a question,
and brought new weapons for the battle of thought
wherein most of us fail from weariness. For them
it has already succeeded, whatever its coming fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unless one sees a glimpse of truth at fifteen, enough
to recognize it, one is not likely to discern it later,
through the mist of unformed knowledge. And at
fifteen one craves this something that can relate and
shape all thought. So it happened that I organized
the club of Seekers, composed of very different girls
and boys, because of this one common need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conditions necessary for membership were
few. The first condition, the one in its nature inevitable,
was that each member should be interested
and enthusiastic in our quest, a seeker from need and
desire. Only such would have stayed with us. And
this, perhaps, was a selective process of extreme rigor.
Otherwise the conditions of membership were not of
the sort to put a premium on extraordinary ability.
They were that the members should be over fourteen,
and under seventeen, and should have finished their
elementary school course. I also limited the membership
in number. Among my acquaintances were
many more girls who would have wished to join us,
but no more than the two boys. I explain this not
by the fact that boys are less interested in these questions,
but that their interest develops later. If I had
sought boys of eighteen or nineteen, I could have
found them easily. At the time, however, I did not
realize this fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think that the children were average of their kind.
The kind, nevertheless, may have carried with it
some intellectual superiority or precocity, such as the
effects of environment and urban life. For these
things, through the chance of acquaintanceship, they
had in common: they were all bred in New York
City, in educated families of the upper middle class
(though not all of well-to-do parents), and all but
one, Ruth, who is a Christian Scientist, of homes unusually
liberal in their religious thought. Therefore
these children were free from those clogging superstitions
and false perspectives which result from early
training in any symbolic and fixed creed. Take these
influences for what they were worth. Beyond them
the children had no special advantage or disadvantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I say all this as a defence against a possible criticism:
namely, that the children seem, by their comprehension
and original ideas, to be far above the
average boys and girls of the same age. This I
deny, and for good reasons. Naturally I have meant
this experiment of a class in religious philosophy for
adolescent boys and girls to be general in its application.
And I believe it to be so. Most grown
people have forgotten how they felt and thought at
fifteen, and are apt to underrate the mental processes
of boys and girls. I myself at that age felt so keenly
the lack of sympathy in older people that I made a
point of remembering and writing down certain experiences.
I questioned several friends, and at last
got admissions from them that they, too, had thought
in the same way at fifteen. But no doubt they still
look upon themselves as unique in this respect, for at
fifteen we all think ourselves exceptions, and no matter
how commonplace we may be now we are apt
vaguely to keep that memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, too, one must not forget the effect of conscious
and unconscious suggestion. I had my plans
carefully made, and knew exactly in what direction
I meant to lead our ideas, but the children knew very
little of this foreplanning, and went of themselves
where I wished them to go. No doubt suggestion
blazed trails for them through this wilderness, if it
did not make a path, and, as my record will prove,
my questions often stimulated them to answers that
would not otherwise have been possible. But often
their answers were wholly unexpected and surprising.
As our name tells, we are seekers, and I have found,
at the very least, as much as they. Above all, my
boundless faith in the young was justified. And my
critics must admit that they have not this faith themselves,
and so could never have put it to the test of
experience, as I have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children’s papers show better than written
words of mine exactly what the meetings meant to
them, and will prove also, I think, their average
ability. They are printed exactly as written, save
for corrections in spelling and punctuation, which
were by no means perfect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversations were recorded as precisely as
possible from memory and from notes taken immediately
after the meetings. As any one with experience
will know, it is impossible to record the broken
fragments of actual speech without sometimes combining
mere phrases into complete sentences. The
written is never like the spoken thought. It appears
like it, which it would not do if it were a precise
phonographic transcription.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have made the children speak “in character,”
using always their own words and their own ideas,
whatever those might be; even being careful to record
characteristic phrases and expressions. And that I
had succeeded was proved by the children themselves,
when they heard the manuscript read and recognized
themselves and each other, to their great amusement.
Not until all the meetings were over had they any
idea that I was keeping this record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We seven, then, have made this book; and one
other one, who, though never present at the meetings,
had his large share of influence in them. This
was my friend and Florence’s big brother Arthur—so
often quoted by her—and quoted by me without
acknowledgment, especially in the meetings on the
æsthetic ideal, which would have been impossible without
his help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all lovers of youth and individual thought, for
all lovers of the quest, we have made this book, as a
personal recognition of the bond of kinship that binds
all free seekers, and as an answer to those vital questions
which all of us must ask together, and answer,
at least in sympathy.</p>

<div><h1><a id='member'></a>THE MEMBERS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Alfred</span>, my cousin, not quite fifteen years old when
the club was begun. In his first high school year.
In appearance, a young Arab chieftain, dark, athletic
and dignified. His character fulfils the promise: he
is taciturn, slow to act, independent, serious for his
age, and with a great thirst for knowledge. A lover
of nature and the country; a hater of all things petty
or mean. He entered the club with a good knowledge
of evolution, and no religious training of any sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Virginia</span>, my cousin, almost sixteen years old. She
had one year of high school, but as she would not
study, and drew pictures instead, she was sent to art
school a year and a half ago, where she has been
working hard. She has read and re-read many good
books. Although she is of a blonde, Saxon type, yet
her hair and eyes are very dark. Light-hearted and
yet earnest, self-satisfied, always sweet and lovable.
Bright, interested, original, humorous. She has had
no definite religious training, but much sound religious
philosophy at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Florence</span>, a young friend, fifteen years old, but
much older in appearance. In her third high school
year. Large and dark, with gray eyes. She is vacillating,
and may turn out to be a fine, independent,
intelligent and forceful woman, or a materialistic,
flippant society lady. It depends on the influences
brought to bear, and on her own will. Somewhat
spoiled. A good student, a good thinker, but not
impelled to think by any great desire. She loves
dancing more than anything else in the world. She
comes from a home of mixed and uncertain piety.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Henry</span>, Florence’s cousin, not quite sixteen years
old, unknown to me before we formed the club. In
his second high school year. A young student, dark,
slim, shy, with much to say, but not yet able to say
it well. He is rather dogmatic, but open to influence,
a born seeker. Often appearing at first to be slow,
or commonplace, he suddenly reveals unexpected understanding
and originality. He comes from a conventional
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Marian</span>, Florence’s friend, also unknown to me
before the club. Fifteen and a half years old. In
her fourth—last—high school year, preparing for
college. A light brunette of a languid and yet intellectual
type. Very intuitive, of quick insight, sympathetic,
a lover of human nature, shy and quiet. A
dreamer and a hero-worshiper. She expresses herself
well, but often in broken sentences and with
hesitation. Her parents belong to the Ethical Culture
Society, and have given her no religious education.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ruth</span>, Marian’s chum, sixteen years old, is also
in her last high school year, preparing to study kindergarten.
A slight, blonde girl, tall, and with her
character written in her face: self-possessed, poise,
idealism. Her voice, enunciation and language are
those of one trained to speak well. Her thought is
unusually developed, but along rather narrow lines.
She loves children, and has chosen her work with an
idealistic devotion. Her mother is Christian, her
father Jewish, and their religion is Christian Science.
She is a convinced Christian Scientist.</p>

<div><h1><a id='first'></a>FIRST MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When we were all gathered about the table at
three o’clock, I opened the discussion thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember that I told you we were going
to speak to-day of the fact that there is almost no
religion at present, and the cause for this? Now,
are we all agreed that there is very little religion—true
religious belief—at present?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All agreed to this except Henry. He said that he
thought people were as religious as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Florence to Henry, “that you are
confusing religion and creed. People belong to
churches and temples, and think they are religious,
but they don’t know what they believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw Henry was not convinced, so I said to him:
“I think perhaps we do not mean the same thing by
religion, therefore we might as well go on, and speak
of it later, when we do understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I believe there is a definite historic reason
for our religious lack, and I will tell it to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I reviewed briefly the history of ancient religions,
Brahmanism, the Egyptian creed, the Greek
and the early Catholic religions, to show that all these
for various reasons—but chiefly because of the ignorance
of the populace—had been, as it were, double
religions. There was an initiated religion of the
priests, who did indeed see truth, who were monotheists
of the universal vision, and were filled with
the sense of unity in all things. Besides this was the
religion of myths, the popular religion. The people
took literally the poetical tales told by the prophets;
and these prophets, or priests, even went so far as to
deceive the people purposely, for what they considered
the people’s good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how the priests could have known the
truth,” Ruth said, “if they meant to deceive the
populace. Those who knew the truth would not wish
to deceive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” I answered; “they had not the
whole truth, but in so far as they saw, they saw
truly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth seemed to doubt this historic account. I
quietly proved to her and the others that it was
true. I read them a passage from Plato’s “Republic,”
in which he recommends telling the people a
myth because belief in it would put them in the
proper frame of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on to explain how the democratic spirit
began to destroy the religion of the initiated. The
aristocracy of religion was as much resented as the
aristocracy of government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result was that every one believed the popular,
mythical religion; and that is what most of our
churches have lived upon since then. All the superstitions
of creeds, the absurd stories that are believed
literally by some people even to-day, are the
poetic symbols of prophets and teachers, accepted as
narratives of fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next came the scientific spirit, and said: “The
world is more than six thousand years old; it was not
created in a week; the whale could not have swallowed
Jonah, and given him up again.” Now people cried
out: “Religion is not true. We will believe nothing
but science.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I spoke of the difference between mythical
and true religion, I found the children already understood
this, that they realized Moses’ true meaning
when he spoke of the burning bush; that they
knew Jesus, when he spoke of himself as the son
of God, meant to express the divinity of man. I
said the true religion spoke in poetry, and the popular
made its figures of speech into gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For instance,” I said, “from where comes the
line, ‘The rosy fingers of the dawn’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Homer,” answered Marian, “from the
Odyssey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I went on, “a person reading that might
say, ‘Just think, the dawn has fingers; then it must
have a hand.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Virginia, “he would add, ‘So the
dawn is a woman.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said one might worship an image of a god, but
if he kept his mind upon the vast divine unity he
would not be an idol worshiper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” objected Henry, “if he did it long enough,
he would become an idol worshiper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might,” I said, “but he need not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we came to the question of science. What has
religion to do with science?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred said science led in the same direction, was
looking for the same thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said science was supposed to be in opposition
to religion, because it destroyed her creeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, I answered him, seemed to me a good thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said she thought religion and science were
almost the same. She meant that her scientific knowledge
of the universe led her to her religious convictions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said she thought science and religion were
altogether separate, had nothing to do with each
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said she did not see how science could help
us to religious knowledge. But it turns out that she
has read no science at all, save what she was taught
in school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said that science was the enemy of religion,
that two things seeking in a different way could not
possibly both reach the truth; that science might tell
us of material facts, but could not possibly give us
the divine truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked: “Are you sure material truth is not
divine truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I said that I myself thought science was the
servant of religion, that it was valuable only in so
far as it helped us to a knowledge of life—divine and
whole—(I said aside to Ruth) and that I did think
it helped us so. It gave us a sense of unity, of our
relation with the whole world, because we knew that
the same law moved us and the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I went on, “Marian mentioned the other
day that she had heard people say they were too
educated to need religion. They meant they knew
too much science. Can science replace religion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all said no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They saw at once that behind every science was
the mystery, the unexplained, and that every scientist
must begin with a philosophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I have heard people say that science disproves
immortality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia answered: “It does not disprove immortality.
It proves, indeed, that nothing ever is destroyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think,” I asked, “that there is such a
thing as absolute religious knowledge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think we can get it? That it is a certain
knowledge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They answered “Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Ruth, “you would want it proved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I used the word “faith,” and the children rightly
objected, because, they said, faith could be used to
express the most superstitious of mythical beliefs.
One must <span class='it'>know</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean self-evident knowledge,” I said. “If to-day
the priests and the myths are dead, if we are to
have a democratic religion, then each one of us must
be a prophet. We here to-day, we seven, shall find
the unanswerable truth. Shall we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I believe so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do we know that such truth is to be reached?
We do know certain things in ourselves? We know
the mystery is there? We know that which we call
God?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there any other reason for believing that the
truth can be known?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “In past times some men have
known it, we feel certain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is just what I meant, Marian. Such men,
you mean, as Moses and Jesus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we here shall get it. We shall know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe,” I said, “that when we have talked
everything over we shall know the truth, and it shall
be the same for each.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fundamentals, perhaps,” said Ruth, “but not
in all things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No religion could be the true religion, we said, if
it fostered antagonism or bitterness toward those of
another persuasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One would wish to teach them,” said Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, what is the truth? We spoke of the
nature of ‘God.’ What is God, the something we
all know and cannot speak?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “I could tell better what I mean by
God by saying what is not God.” We tried to make
him explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing is not God,” said Virginia, “everything
is God, good and bad, too; and the bad only seems
bad to us, but really leads to good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything is not God,” said Ruth, “for God is
perfect, and we are imperfect, and are striving for
his perfection. Imperfection and all bad things are
not of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they, then?” I asked. “Surely you do
not believe in two gods, like the Zoroastrians, in a
good and a bad? But the wisest of them saw that
the two were one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth answered: “I have it at home in a book,
how evil came into God’s world, although we are of
him and he is perfect. I will bring it next time.
I don’t remember it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do bring it. But I believe that as long as
we are not perfect, God is not perfect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That seems,” answered Ruth, “as if we were
God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we are a part of God, who is the whole. Anything
else is unthinkable. And unless we are perfect,
how can He be perfect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children corrected me, for I had used the
wrong word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God must be perfect,” they said, “if we long for
that perfection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “If the world is ever to be perfect,
then it is perfect now. Whatever shall be is here
now, is here forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” I answered, “I should not have
used that word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “The apple-tree might be perfect,
but the apples might still be unripe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I went on, “but the apple-tree would not
be perfect unless the apples ripened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The world is like a rose-bud,” said Alfred. “It
is perfect as a bud, and yet it must open and evolve in
its perfection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “or like a sleeper who awakens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, then,” I asked, “you do all believe in progress;
that the world changes and that it changes in a
certain direction?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Virginia. “I believe that the
world, that God, must always be the same, even
though it change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true, and it is a strange paradoxical truth,
which I hope to make you understand later on, that
all things change and progress, yet are ever the same,
even as the rose-bud that unfolds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had tacitly admitted that God and the aim of
life stood for love and unity. Once when Henry
spoke of the “fear” of God, the others corrected
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I said, “if there is progress, what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth answered: “There is progress of individuals,
not of the world. Certain men saw the truth as
clearly in old times as they could now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not believe so,” I answered her. “I think
the whole must evolve and bud forth, and that it
does. Now you all admit that Moses was a prophet
who saw the truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said “Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he felt enmities. Jesus was a greater prophet
than Moses. In what was he greater?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In his realization not only of the unity of God,
but of the unity and divinity and love of man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Moses were here to-day,” I asked, “in what
might he be greater than he was in his own time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “He would have all the advantages
of culture since then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would not make him greater.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian answered: “You mean the democracy of
to-day, the realization of the brotherhood of all men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “that is just what I mean. When
I look at history, I can see no progress but this. Automobiles,
electricity, scientific knowledge, these are
not progress except as they lead to that other progress.
We do understand our fellowmen better than
we ever did. We can—some of us—call every savage
our brother. That is the clear progress throughout
history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children were impressed by this fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you mean,” said Ruth, “that universal love
is the object of life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “but I am afraid to use the word
‘love,’ for it might mean blind love, and I mean understanding
love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean love of mankind?” asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “but individual love, too; and perhaps
more than both of these.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I still believe,” said Ruth, “that progress is only
for the individual, and that it doesn’t matter whether
we progress here or hereafter. Personal love is selfish.
We want divine love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered her: “I will not speak now of hereafter.
But here and now, to-day, do we not want at
once the thing that we want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, now and here we mean to go forward, as
far as we can, and now and here we will love men
with our might, because that is the human way and
the human progress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does seem to me, from books,” said Virginia,
“that people are less mean, selfish and jealous than
they were a hundred years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian smiled over to her. “You have been reading
Thackeray,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Virginia, “all people are not progressing
together, for though we should find the truth
now, many others will not find it for a long time. The
world is like a bunch of roses, in which some are full-blown,
and others are small buds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered her; “and for the whole to
evolve, each bud must be unfolded in beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we said many things beside these, but these
were the chief trend and conclusions of our thought.
I also told them how every moment was a promise
and a fulfillment, a state of the endless whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next Sunday each is to tell me what he or she
does mean by the word “God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children were enthusiastic, uplifted, whole-hearted
in their interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia and Alfred, who stayed some time after
the others, had a long discussion on good and bad,
in which I refused to join.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said she thought all bad things had good
results, and could be used for good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred answered he was not sure of that, but he
believed bad to be a necessary part of good. He
said: “If I never felt ill, I could not know I felt
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “Reason made evil, for when creatures
became reasonable they knew that the things
they had done before were wrong.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='second'></a>SECOND MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke of the name of our club, the Seekers. I
said that I thought it expressed exactly what we meant
to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth answered that to her it seemed the only possible,
natural name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I read aloud Virginia’s account of the last
meeting:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great many people think themselves too educated
to believe in any of the established religions,
and then don’t take the trouble to find out what they
really think and what their true religion is. People
have a wrong idea of the meaning of the word
‘religious.’ Consequently, as they don’t know what
it means, they cannot <span class='it'>be</span> it. Many people who go to
church or temple every Sabbath, and sleep, or take
note of the different costumes of the congregation
during the sermon, consider themselves religious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We decided that we all believed in the unity of
God. The truth has always been apparent to some,
such as Moses and Jesus, and some of the Oriental
priests. The two former tried to give the true idea
to the people, but failed, as they were too poetical,
and the people believed too literally. The latter
tried to keep the people in ignorance, as it gave them
power, and they therefore told the people what they
themselves knew to be untruths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We differed somewhat in our idea of God. Some
thought he was all good and had no evil. I think he
is all good, but I also think that all evil is his, but
that every evil has a good motive and a good end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No idea, no matter how surprising and new it may
seem, is new. It has always been, although it has
never been thought. The world is like a great bunch
of rosebuds, each perfect as a bud, but not developed.
Every beautiful idea, when it is thought, is a petal
unfolding and revealing <span class='it'>more</span> perfect petals beneath.
Thus one fine idea brings forth another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think a great many people do not know what
they think. If you ask a person belonging to one of
the established religions what they believe, I think
their answer would be vague. Formerly, these religions
were very useful, as they made people love
good. Now they prevent people from thinking, and
make them dependent. They depend on others to
make their beliefs and thoughts, when their brains
should be, and probably are, fertile enough to think
for themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that was just what I wanted, and I hoped
to have one such paper each week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I believed that after we had spoken of God,
and decided what we meant, and all agreed, we would
not often use the word God, because it was so nearly
unspeakable, so vast and holy, that we would take
it as a natural background to our thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” I said, “how in the old Jewish temples
the name of God was mentioned only once a
year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then only by the priest,” Henry added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if we want to talk of God we shall have to
use his name,” said Ruth. The others seemed to
agree with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The personal significance always clings to the
name of God,” Marian said; “but what other word
can one use?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it would be better,” suggested Henry,
“to use some such other word as All-powerful One.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said that to her the word God had no
personal significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth thought we might use the impersonal word
“Good.” I answered her that every attribute, even
good, was limiting, and God was limitless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw that they did not in the least understand what
I meant, that they could not until we went further.
So I said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that after we know what we mean by
the word God, you will understand why we shall not
want, and not need, to use it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I asked them what they meant by God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “God is the whole, good and bad,
only what seems bad is really good. Or God is,
rather, every feeling, every emotion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said God was everything good, but that
everything <span class='it'>was</span> good, and bad only seemed bad to
us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred said: “I don’t think bad is good, but I
think that God must be everything, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian tried to say that God is the vast unknown—something,
which we know because we feel it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “I spoke to brother Arthur about
it, and I now think that God is sympathy; that is,
sympathy and understanding of our fellow-men; and
as we reach that, we get to God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others were surprised and startled by this explanation.
I said I knew what Florence meant, but
that she had not been able to express it clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Ruth said that she agreed with Henry. She
called God spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “if we take spirit to mean everything.
For we know nothing except through our
senses, our consciousness, our understanding; so that
all we know is knowledge of spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all agreed to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I said, “I believe God to be in each of us,
to be the self within us, and within all others, and
within the universe; to be the knowledge, the light
and the understanding. I can explain to you what
I mean by reading a passage from the Indian Vedas,
which seems to me so true, and so exactly what I
want to say, that I could not explain it so well myself.”
Then I read the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the beginning was Self alone. Atman is the
Self in all our selves—the Divine Self concealed by
his own qualities. This Self they sometimes call the
Undeveloped.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The generation of Brahma
was before all ages, unfolding himself evermore in a
beautiful glory; everything which is highest and
everything which is deepest belongs to him. Being
and not being are unveiled through Brahma.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
How can any one teach concerning Brahma? He is
neither the known nor the unknown. That which
cannot be expressed by words, but through which
all expression comes, this I know to be Brahma.
That which cannot be thought by the mind, but by
which all thinking comes, this I know is Brahma.
That which cannot be seen by the eye, but by which
the eye sees, is Brahma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They liked this so well, and said it expressed their
feelings so truly, that I offered to copy it for each
one of them. Marian said she did not understand
what was meant by “concealed by his own qualities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered: “We know God only because of
the universe which we see and feel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But just that the universe,” I went on, “conceals
God, is a mystery as well as a revelation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite understand,” said Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is like a great light,” I said, “which is so bright
that it dazzles you, and you cannot look at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like the sun,” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I see what you mean,” Marian answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I continued: “Moses spoke of God in that same
way, as the vast Self: ‘And God said unto Moses,
I Am That I Am; and he said, Thus shalt thou say
unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto
you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so,” I went on, “myself and yourself, the
self of every man and the self of the universe, that
is God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With delightful frankness they said that they liked
it better as it was put in “that thing on Brahma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” I answered. “We know only self. Is
it not so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like the word ‘self,’” said Ruth; “it is too
limited. I think only of my little self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian agreed. Virginia said that to her it seemed
the true word, that she felt the whole as a vast self.
“But isn’t it more?” she asked. “God is feeling.
When I ride in an open trolley, and the wind blows
in my face, and the trees blow, and the clouds move
in the sky, then the feeling that it gives me I call
God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it self, within yourself?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I said, “we are little, incomplete, limited
creatures, but we need the whole universe to be complete.
The whole universe is the rest of self, the
rest of myself. That is what I mean by God, and in
that sense I am a part of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the children agreed at once, as if this were the
thing they had wanted to hear said. This first definite
statement that I made seemed to us all unanswerably
true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately they went on to speak of good and
bad; but I stopped them, thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is one other thing I would like to make
clear first, a historic question, but one that leads to
the question of good and bad. What did the most
illumined and inspired polytheists mean by their many
gods?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian answered: “They meant many aspects
of the one God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so, Marian. But now do you know the inner
meaning of Trinity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of them knew, and all seemed particularly
interested and anxious to understand. “I never understood,”
said Marian, “what was meant by the
Holy Ghost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said to them: “I will tell you what it has always
meant to me, and to some others beside me,
and you can see whether it seems true to you. To
me the three are as parts of one. They are the contrast,
such as man and God, good and bad, even night
and day, and the understanding, the unity that makes
these two one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This needed much explanation. It was all summed
up thus: The three in one—the triangle with three
sides, which is still one—are: Myself, the other self,
which I love and need for my completion, and the
love and understanding which pass between us and
make us one. Virginia said that she never thought
of herself and the other self, that to her they were
one. The idea was very new to them all, and did not
at once convince them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I said, “we see, however, that opposites
are really one; and so I believe that good and bad are
parts of the same thing. I believe that everything
called bad is the price of going forward, of progress,
that bad things are made by good things. Suppose
that the world were in utter darkness, that no light
were anywhere, then there would be no darkness,
either. But the first flame of light would create the
darkness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I developed this idea, the children said very
little, only asking me questions, until I had finished.
This is how I explained it: We all believe—we
seven here—that the good is understanding, love, the
complete Divine Self, and everything which leads
thereto is good. Then everything bad is that which
does not lead thereto; or, rather, that is called bad
which has not gone so far as the rest. So that the
bad is not an actual state—in this I agree with Ruth—but
is a condition of good. All pains are growing
pains. Things are bad only because we already have
something better. The other day I heard Virginia
saying that when reason came into the world, creatures
first knew the bad; because they saw that the
life they had lived was a bad life. So, you see, everything
bad is something which we feel to be behind
us, not equal to our best knowledge. Pain and badness
are the price of progress, and we would rather
go forward and suffer than stand still and be comfortable.
We long to go forward to the good, to the
vast self of complete understanding. “A criminal,”
I said, “may be a man who would have been good
if he had lived in savage times among savages, but
at present he is bad because we are ahead of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then a bad man,” said Henry, “is one who is
behind his times, or else ahead of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” they protested, “not ahead of them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “but the man ahead of his
time, who is better than his time, may appear to be
a criminal. You must see that the man who believes
in the eternal good, who knows that he is going
toward unity and complete love, is in a sense above
the human law, and must discover his own laws. He
may be a criminal in the eyes of others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give us an example,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jesus is one example. He was crucified as a
criminal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” said Henry, “he broke the Roman law.
He refused to worship their images, and he called
himself King of the Jews.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they did not know,” I answered, “in what
sense he called himself King, so they had to crucify
him as a traitor. Can’t you think of some other example?
Of course, there were all the heretics of old
times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred and Henry said that Roosevelt was in a
sense an example, because he had been much blamed
for exposing the truth and hurting business; but that
the hurt was an essential part of progress and good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said: “Surely it is better to expose the truth
and suffer for it, than to go on in falsehood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gave as another example the Russians, with
whom, a short time ago, it was a crime to educate the
peasants; and I told how brave men and women had
been sent to Siberia for breaking the law in this respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I said, “this is a dangerous subject, and
truly, we ought not to have mentioned it until we
could probe it to the bottom. For surely in a democratic
state one of the essential inner laws is that we
shall obey the law which our fellows have made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a law seems wrong to a man,” said Henry, “he
can try to change it, but meantime he must obey it.
For instance, a man might believe in free trade, but
still he would have no right to smuggle in goods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One ought to obey school-laws, I suppose,” said
Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” I answered, “for the school is an institution
you enter from choice, and if you don’t like
the laws you can protest by leaving. But if there were
a law unjust to your fellows, you would disobey it.
Still, even then, the best way to protest would be by
a strike of the students.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had a long discussion on the great crime of
whispering in school, in which I scarcely joined, as I
refuse to be a petty preacher to them. But I tried
to explain to them why it was so hard for them to
obey these little laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” I said, “because you did not help to make
the laws yourselves, that you are tempted to break
them out of mere mischief. Still, you would not lie
about it, but rather do it openly, because you feel that
truth between individuals is an inner law, the first
step toward understanding. You know I believe
that, even unconsciously, we have all always striven
for this unity, this completeness that now we are
going to strive for with open eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all bad leads in the same direction, and comes
to good,” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I want you to understand that clearly,” I
said. “All bad things are bad only because they do
not reach up to our idea of the best. But that bad
things are turned to good, or used for good is because
we use them so; because the desire and the striving
for good is so strong within us, that we use them to
fulfil that desire. It is not a necessity. It is a matter
of choice. If we wish, we can use everything for
good. And we often do so, even unconsciously.
Everything strives toward that good, which is life
itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you believe,” said Marian, “that even every
criminal has some good in him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, surely,” I answered, “else he would not be
here, alive, at all. Every living being is good; and
if he is not so far as we at present, he may go farther
than we some day. Surely, we will take him onward
with us, else we cannot be complete. You must see
that any one who believes the great good to be understanding
love and unity, cannot be made whole
till every one is made whole with him. He needs
all the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every one must feel that,” said Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other day, Marian,” I went on, “you said:
‘If we can never reach the goal, what is the good of
anything?’ Now, I, for one, believe in infinite good;
I believe that no matter how far we go, we shall long
to go farther, so that what now would seem unimaginably
good to us might one day seem bad. Can
you imagine stagnant perfection?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Marian, “that a perfectly good
world would be terribly monotonous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I think, too,” I answered. “What
we love is the going forward, the achieving, the
striving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “It is like travelling toward the horizon,
and we think that is the end. But when we reach
it, we see another horizon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth asked: “How can we strive for anything, if
we don’t expect to reach it? Is not God what we
long to reach? Is not God the ideal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is not God, the real, here, now?” I answered her.
“I cannot understand Infinity or Eternity, so I say
Infinity is here and Eternity is now, because I am
always here and now. So I cannot understand infinite
good and unity, but I know that here and now I must
strive for it, and that the constant striving, and getting
more and ever more, is my greatest joy. Now,
Ruth, do you admit that we cannot go forward alone,
that all must go together to be complete?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the whole is one, and every man and creature
is a part of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If every one believed that,” said Marian, “how
different, how much better the world would be! People
could not criticize each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> think it would,” I said, “and I am glad you
think so, too; for if every one believed that, no one
could condemn another, any more than you could condemn
your own sore finger. You might say: ‘My
finger is sore,’ but you wouldn’t say: ‘My finger is
very wicked, and I hate it.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that,” said Marian. “I am convinced
mentally, but I don’t feel it. I don’t think that I
could live it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia asked whether she might say for us “Abou
ben Adhem,” which expressed our idea of man and
God. And she said it for us. We were all silent for
a few moments. Then I said: “And the love of
even more than man, of all creatures, of all the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian admitted that she did not love animals.
Ruth said she did. Marian seems distressed by the
fact that she cannot be perfect at once. That is what
she means when she says she is mentally convinced,
but doesn’t feel it yet. Alfred feels the same lack.
These ambitious children!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I said, “I want you to feel certain and
convinced of each thing as we go on. We all agree
at present, don’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” they answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel as if something must be wrong, because
we all agree,” I went on, “and yet I know you are
independent thinkers. Are you sure that all bad is
a condition of good, even all physical bad, such things
as accidents and loss? For instance, railroads are of
value—why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None knew the true reason but Ruth. She said
they brought nations together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the accidents on railroads,” I said, “are the
price of that progress, a price we have to pay for perfecting
that system. It would be better to avoid all
accidents—as I hope we shall do one day—but, meanwhile,
we would rather take the risk than not have
railroads. No one can be convinced, however, that
all bad is a condition of good, until tried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been tried,” answered Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all thought themselves convinced, except Alfred.
He said: “It might be true nine times, but the
tenth time it might not be true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Henry, “you would believe it were
true the tenth time, even though you didn’t understand
how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered; “he would test it the tenth
time. We will <span class='it'>know</span> each thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we re-examined our conviction on all these
questions, and went over each point again. We
probed the possibilities of atheism, and saw that no
one who faced things could be an atheist, that atheism
was the result of laziness, fear or vanity. Either a
man feared to face the truth, or could not bear to
admit how little he knew. And <a id='wesaw'></a>we saw that an
atheist might be a very good man, only he would
build his morality on a philosophy he did not understand
or examine. We might be good without any
religious convictions, but this conviction, this belief,
would give us a reason for goodness, and make us
strong in the face of uncertainty, temptation and
trial. Henry said things were worth while only when
they were hard to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” said I, “you have a proof of our instinctive
feeling that pain is a necessary part of progress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said she wanted to believe what would
make her happy; that she would choose the optimistic
faith. I answered her I wanted to believe the truth,
happy or unhappy, but I had come to the conclusion
at last that the truth was very good. I told them
how at their age I had been in great doubt, how I
had thought the truth might be very bad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pain is real,” I said, “but we will not fear to face
that, or anything bitter, when we know it to be a
condition of going onward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said I was shaping her thought for her.
I reminded her how she used to be my “little disciple.”
All the others, and especially Marian, said
that this meeting was far more satisfying than the
last; that we had reached something definite. Marian
said: “I seem to see already what we will have to
say on every subject, but we shall have no end of
things to speak of.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='third'></a>THIRD MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Florence and Henry were delayed and did not
arrive until after four. But before that we had already
gathered about the table, and found it hard
to restrain ourselves from beginning the discussion.
I said to the children that I thought we would not
speak of immortality to-day, as there was too much
that came before. I asked them whether they were
anxious to get to it. They were very anxious. Florence
said: “It is such an important subject.” Ruth
said: “I believe we will all agree on immortality.”
I answered her that just there I thought we might
disagree most. Marian said she had definite ideas
on the subject. I can see that Henry has indefinite
and theological ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I then read aloud the little paper Marian had written
on our talk of the previous week:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On Sunday, October 18th, our club, the Seekers,
held its second meeting. We first discussed our ideas
of God. We reached the conclusion that God is
our divine self, that through God we can perceive,
but we cannot perceive God. This seems to me a
very beautiful idea. I think our discussion on this
subject was particularly nice, because we did not try
to limit God by any attributes, for he is infinite. We
also discussed progress. I understood it much better
this week than last. The aim of progress is to reach
a clear understanding of our fellow-beings; we hope
that, sometime, there will be sympathy and understanding
among all men, for we each have a divine
self, which will not reach perfection until it is in
perfect accord with all the other people’s. We discussed
good and evil, and decided that evil is that
which we outgrow, and which might once have
seemed good, but which now seems bad because we
have found something better. Good is the progress
that we are making toward our goal of common understanding.
Unhappiness and accidents, etc., are incidental
to progress, and will occur less and less frequently.
I enjoyed this meeting of the club very
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now reviewed all the conclusions we had
reached. Then I was glad to have them speak once
more of good and bad, and ask many questions. Ruth
said she was not sure of being convinced. She said:
“I talked it over with mother. It seems to me I sometimes
put my thought into your words, and imagine
you have said what I mean, when perhaps you
haven’t. Please repeat that again, about good and
bad.” Ruth is always afraid she may be weakening
in her own ideas, and tries not to be convinced. I
strove to impress upon her that my idea might include
hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “You see now that the thought I want to
give you is an unanswerable religion, which is not
new, but larger than all the old beliefs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian asked: “Large enough to include them
all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, just that. Did you ever think of the old
word, holiness, h-o-l-i-n-e-s-s? I know another word
that to us would mean holiness, a different holiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean w-h-o-l-e?” said Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to be whole and complete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now as we spoke again of good and bad, we came
upon the interesting question of disease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can that be explained as a part of progress?”
asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia, with her usual misconception on this subject,
said that disease helped us forward because
through it scientists came to know and understand
many things about life. Henry, still more off the
track, said that disease led to a knowledge of medicine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Henry’s idea,” I answered, “we cannot consider,
because, of course, the only virtue of medical skill
is that it cures disease, and if there were not disease
we would not need medical progress. But Virginia’s
idea is true in a certain sense. It is quite true that
disease impelled people to use the microscope, to discover
themselves physically, to learn of the infinitude
of minute creatures in the universe; and so it led to a
larger knowledge of life, because the infinitely little
makes our world just as vast as the infinitely big.
But this only shows that we made progress out of
disease, as we make progress out of all things, because
the will of life, the will to go forward, is within us.
It does not show how disease itself can be the result
or price of progress. That is a difficult question, but
I seem to see it clearly, and I will try to explain it to
you. None of you, except perhaps Virginia and Alfred,
have a clear idea of evolution, and I would like
to spend one meeting in explaining it, because it is so
essential. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t go into this question of disease without
explaining something of evolution to you now. I
will try to make it clear: Each individual is different.
As animals progressed and went forward, those parts
which were newest were also more unstable, because
they were ready to change more. These parts were
most apt to become diseased, or, rather, weakened,
because progress might be in any direction, and had
to feel its way.” It was difficult for me to explain
this to the children, who were so utterly unprepared,
and I said much more. Even so, I don’t think Marian
and Ruth understood it thoroughly, and I shall have
to repeat it when we speak of evolution. I said I
did not believe the germs of disease ever entered any
part unless that part were weakened or imperfect.
I said: “Take as an example the human brain. Suppose
that two children were born with brains slightly
different from others. One might turn out to be a
genius, and the other to be eccentric and even insane,
because progress feels its way in all directions. So
disease, coming to the new unstable parts, would be
the necessary cost of progress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “Young and new things are always
most delicate. I had a palm with many leaves, and
one was new. Now, the palm was left for a day
against the window pane, and the young leaf died
from the pressure of the glass, which did not at all
hurt the old leaves.” This poetical and delightful
little figure of speech made me wonder whether Virginia
understood just what I meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went over the question of good and bad, to
Ruth’s satisfaction. And then I asked Henry, whose
understanding of it I doubted, to tell me in what
three ways the bad was a part of good and progress.
His answer was clear and true:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the bad, which is only bad because we
now possess or know something better, the old good
we have left behind us. Then there is the bad which
is the direct result of progress and growth, such as
accidents and disease. Then there is the use of bad
which we make, to turn it into good, such as the
knowledge we get from it, and, as Virginia said before,
the sympathy and love which grow out of
misfortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I said, “I would like some of you to tell
me what you mean by those two words, matter and
spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry, Virginia and Ruth were the only ones
ready to answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said that spirit is the soul. He quoted from
a Sunday-school formula: “The spirit of man is in
the image of God, and immortal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that those words did not mean anything
definite to me. They might be true, but I did not
understand them. Ruth said she did, and it was
what she meant; that matter was, like the bad, something
to be overcome and left behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Virginia, “that matter is the tool
of spirit; the body is the servant of the mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They began to argue, but I stopped them, saying:
“I will first tell you what I think. Is there any matter
without form? Has not all matter form, and is it
not, therefore, as it were, something like an idea in
the mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry wanted to deny this, but thought a moment,
and admitted that all matter had some form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on: “I am a spirit, that is, a self; and I
know things only in my spirit, because I see, hear,
touch them. So I don’t believe in matter, so called,
at all. I think that our forms, our bodies, and all
forms in the universe are an expression of spirit or
self.” I said expression was the means for reaching
unity, that creatures could not come together unless
they expressed themselves to each other, and that I
believed all expression was for this purpose. I said,
what is called matter, the material conditions of life,
are the result of the action of spirit; our bodies, which
seem so solid and material, are constantly changed,
are not at all the same as matter, but only in form;
we are reborn each day according to the spirit. I
said that in this sense matter, so-called, was indeed
something we were constantly leaving behind us, that
every material condition was the result of a previous
state of mind. This is true of all human things,
and we cannot help thinking it is true of universal
things. We know that fire burns, that planets whirl
through space, that water runs, and we cannot help
feeling these expressions of force to be the expression
of something akin to will and spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said, then there must be something much
more than human sympathy and understanding, which
we long to reach. I answered, I believed so, but I
had not wanted to suggest it to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that all our present bodily conditions, the
seemingly unalterable conditions called material, were
the expression of will and spirit in the past, either of
ours or others; that our very existence here, the existence
of everything, was the result of will and desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “I don’t think it is just that we
should suffer and be, because of another’s will and
spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia answered: “It <span class='it'>is</span> fair. We are part of
the whole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so,” said Marian. “Of course.” It was
a full and sufficient answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I believed that disease could be prevented,
even if not cured, by thought, because will and desire
controlled the body. I said: “We have our own
destiny in our hands, we are free to do as we choose
with the future, because will shapes everything.” I
was delighted to find that the children had never
heard the silly discussions about free will, and did
not have to have that bugbear driven out. I said:
“We are a part of the will of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As another illustration of idea coming before form,
I spoke of plants and seeds, how in the seed is the
possibility, the idea of an infinity of trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “In them spirit seems to be asleep,
for it must be there.” She said all things slept sometimes,
and while they slept the spirit worked in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth was not in the least convinced. Indeed, the
thing was not overclear. She said: “I still think
matter is something to be overcome, something that
binds us. Surely we will sometime be spirits without
matter, altogether spiritual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I tried to show them that spirit without expression
would be unthinkable, that though expression might
not be what we call matter, it would still be some expression.
I said: “Expression frees us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was puzzling, and needed more explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked Henry: “What is the object and aim of
life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered vaguely: “I suppose it is spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what do you mean by that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered: “I suppose we don’t know what it
is until we reach the truth.” Evidently he did not,
but all the others did. They all spoke at once to explain
to him that the object of life was complete understanding
and love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “That is what expression is to get for us,
for we express ourselves in form and thought, so that
we may understand and be understood. And that is
what I meant by freedom. I meant understanding,
love and perfect adjustment. In one sense matter is
binding, because we want more freedom. Matter, so
called, is the physical condition which our will made
in the past, and which we want already to surpass.
Suppose that a man wrote a book in which he put all
his ideas, and that when he finished the book he was
forbidden to write or speak again; his ideas would
grow afterward, and as he could not express them,
he would think himself limited and bound by the
book he had written. So material conditions are binding
only because we want still more freedom, though
they themselves were freedom at the time of their
creation. In that sense, Ruth, you might call the body
something which the spirit constantly wants to leave
behind, because it is creating new forms for itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “It is as if there were a house with
many rooms, and we thought we wanted to go only
into the first; but each door made us long for the
next room, and the next, so that we could never be
satisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if one door were locked,” I said, “we would
consider ourselves sadly bound, though we had
thought we wished to go only so far. Suppose a man
made a statue, that statue would be an expression of
his spirit. But if the next instant he wanted to
change it, to make, say, the lines of the arm more
perfect, he could not do so by willing. He would
have to make a new statue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that is different,” said Ruth. “The stuff he
works in is still matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I tried to explain how all creation is an inter-change
of form, a flowing and influence. I tried to
show them how all things whatsoever, even thoughts,
are forms, and all form an expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “Those who write books, or do
any great work, are immortal in that, because of
their influence.” I answered her that all of us were
immortal in this sense, that each thing had endless
influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian asked the one unanswerable question, and
I was delighted. She said: “Why was the Divine
Self ever divided? How did we ever happen to need
bodies and expression? Why did it not all grow together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw that contrast was needed for recognition.
But why, she wondered, was anything at all? I answered
her: “We said the other day that it did not
matter whether the search for good were infinite or
not. Neither does it concern us to know the unknowable,
whether or how the awaking world began. But
we do know it is awakening, what is the direction,
what is the aim and desire of life. To me no more
seems needed. We know how to go forward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true,” she said. She spoke of old age
and mental decay. She said she did not see why
people lost, for no reason, the progress they seemed
to have made. I answered her that I did not think
they lost it, unless they did not try to keep it; that it
is a thing one must work for at each moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why do they stop trying?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think they stop,” I said. “I think they
never did try, but in youth such people merely had
more stimulation from without.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my grandfather,” she said, “was an intelligent
man, and he is losing his memory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he losing the valuable thing? Does he love
you less, understand you less? Are you sure the
memory he is losing is the thing he still needs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw what I meant. She was struck by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on: “One might lose the ability to do
mathematics, when one had gained all there was to be
got out of mathematics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said: “I think you are right. I understand
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now when Ruth insisted again that matter was
something binding, something to be left behind,
Alfred said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think it is binding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither do I,” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither do I,” said I, “for we can always express
ourselves in a new way. The man who has
written a book is not dumb afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting was very short and unsatisfactory. I
believe that the children went home disappointed, for
I could see that we had not got at anything that the
children had not understood. Since then Virginia’s
mother told me that Virginia did not enjoy it as
much as the other meetings; that it was too deep for
her. Florence’s “big brother Arthur” told me that
she, too, did not enjoy it as much, and that when he
questioned her she seemed to understand clearly only
the fact that there was no sharp distinction between
mind and matter. Otherwise, as he put it, she “talked
woolly.” During the meeting she yawned once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, then, this meeting was a failure. As such,
I want to use it. What was the cause? Of course,
one of the chief causes was the difficulty of the subject,
and yet the unavoidability of it. How could I
go on to speak of immortality to children with such
absurd notions? I don’t think it could be “skipped.”
Of course, I would at first suppose that my method
of tackling the subject was at fault. It may be so,
but at present I can think of no other method. I
think that the real and remediable cause of the difficulty
was this: That the children did not have a
good enough conception of the philosophy of science,
actual knowledge of cosmic facts, to understand my
point of view. I should have had the talk on evolution
first. To remedy this as much as possible, I
am going to have the talk on evolution next. To
speak of immortality now would cause still more confusion.
I await next Sunday with some uncertainty
and doubt. For the next meeting must be good, or
the club will be a failure. We must learn by experience,
they as well as I. I will go forward with
courage, if my little army does not fail me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I were giving again the talk on matter and
spirit, I would do it differently. I would not say
“matter is the expression of spirit,” but “matter is
the medium through which spirit expresses itself.”
For matter is something, though we know not what,
and never know it except as form, which seems to
us always an expression of will. But we know that,
whatever it be, it passes from one controlling will to
another. (Of course, it is too difficult to be discussed
in this fashion by boys and girls.)</p>

<div><h1><a id='fourth'></a>FOURTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>After all, the last meeting was not such a failure
as I had supposed. I asked Alfred to come earlier,
and questioned him before the others arrived. He
answered me with precision and common sense. He
said: “All matter was once spirit, is the result of
spirit.” When I said: “What we call matter is the
medium through which spirit expresses itself,” he
answered: “Yes, but spirit expresses itself in other
ways, too.” “Think a minute,” said I, “does it?
Can the spirit express itself through any other medium?”
“No,” he said, after thinking a moment,
“no, of course not.” “Nor,” said I, “do we at all
know matter except through the intellect.” I told
him that I wanted to speak to him alone because he
was so silent at the club. Then Henry arrived. He
said he enjoyed the last meeting very much, and
thought he understood it all. The paper he wrote
proved that he understood far better than I had
supposed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day we first went over what we had said last
week. The question arose as to which class of evil
disease belongs. We came to the conclusion that it
is the result or price of progress. We also spoke
about the idea of a trinity. We had said at the last
meeting that God is a divine self within us, and that
when we know each other we will know God. Connecting
each one of us to the other, there is a feeling
of sympathy, a third element. That is to say, there
is you, and myself, and, making the third part, that
sympathetic understanding which brings us closer together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The chief topic to-day was that of Matter and
Spirit. At first there was a little difference of opinion,
but we finally agreed that in reality everything is
spirit, and that which we call matter is only the expression
of the spirit. As an example we took the
sculptor, who, getting an idea through the mind,
expresses this spirit in a statue, which we call matter.
We speak of the body as matter, but it is spirit, in
as much as it is the medium through which the spirit
manifests itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I told the children I had decided to take
up evolution before immortality, because evolution
was the problem of creation, they were all satisfied
and interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I read aloud Marian’s little paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On Sunday, October 25th, the Seekers held a
regular meeting. We first reviewed our discussion
of the last week, and then took up the subject of
Matter and Spirit. Our discussion was long, and
the conclusion we reached was that matter is an expression
of spirit. In the first place, matter is that
which has form or qualities. Every material thing
is the expression of a thought. If a man makes a
table, he does so because he wishes to, because it is
his will to do so. If he writes a book, that book is
an expression of his thought, but it is what is commonly
called matter. Matter is, in short, a result of
spirit, is an expression of spirit. Our bodies are the
expression of our minds, and the way in which we
express ourselves to each other. If our bodies are
not perfect, if they are diseased, it is merely that our
minds have not advanced far enough to express the
perfect body. Our talk this week helped me a great
deal. Although we did not cover much ground,
we reached a conclusion on one of the most difficult
subjects, and I think almost every one was convinced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said she had thought all the week of what I
had told them, and that she was sure she agreed with
me now. The children’s thoughts seem to develop
during the week, as if they shaped afterward, and
slowly, all that had been said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia disagreed with Marian, that the perfect
mind would make the perfect body. She said: “People
with perfect bodies are often fools. And sickly
people are often the most intelligent and fine spirited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian and Ruth both protested, but could not
express themselves. So I said: “That is true. But
still I believe the perfect mind would have the perfect
body. Our bodies may be imperfect for several
reasons: Perhaps we are suffering for the wrong
spirit of our ancestors, through heredity. Or, again,
the body which may be good enough, and quite perfect,
even, with the fool’s mind, might not be strong
enough for the active mind. That mind would have
to create for itself a more perfect body. So, you
see, our bodily imperfections are the price of progress.
Our upright position, for instance, which is so great
a help to the mind, is a strain on the body, and the
cause of many of our ills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said: “I think our bodies will become so
much better than they are now, that the best we
know now will seem very poor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia had written a little paper, which seemed
to me at the first reading so vague and uncomprehending,
that I did not wish to read it aloud. I was
glad I did read it aloud, however, as her explanation
and interpretation of herself showed that she understood.
This is the paper:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>MY IDEA OF MATTER</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matter is a part of mind. Without it there
would be no improvement of the mind. Mind, without
matter, would be like a stunted child. It would
still exist, but it would not grow. It seems as if
matter were the medium between mind and progress.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said that was her own idea, whether we
agreed or not. It means, according to Virginia, that
matter is the medium of expression of mind, and
that mind could not grow without this medium. Very
good, it seems to me; and we do agree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, and Ruth and Henry joined me, that one
must make a distinction, for convenience, at least, between
the words “spirit” and “matter.” Marian said
they had been separated so long, so completely and
so foolishly, that she was glad to dwell upon their
sameness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I went on to speak of evolution.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> I showed
them how the theory of evolution, or descent from
a common ancestor or ancestors, was a creation theory,
just as much as Genesis was a creation theory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “There is no reason why you should believe
this any more than any other history, or story,
unless the proofs convince you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred and Virginia said it was a reasonable, convincing
theory. Marian saw what I meant, and, not
knowing so much as they, asked for the proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I first gave them the proof of likeness of structure,
and showed them pictures of the resemblances
of bone and organ structure in various animals. Ruth
said she was quite sure all little babies were like monkeys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I gave the proof of the race-likeness of the
young. (Examples and illustrations.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then that of rudimentary organs. (Examples and
illustrations.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia suggested the geological proof in the finding
of fossils. I enlarged on this, and spoke of series
of living and extinct shells, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I traced the general progress of evolution, the division
into groups and branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told them—what some knew—that evolution was
an ancient, philosophical theory, and only the method
of evolution Darwinian. Some of them said Darwin’s
name always made them think of monkeys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now went on to explain Darwin’s theory of
natural selection; spoke of variation in all directions
as the law of life; then explained the struggle for
food and place, and then protective colorings, and
consequent elimination. The children gave as many
examples and instances as myself. Then I went on
to tell what artificial selection had been able to do,
and showed a group of pictures of the dog, domesticated
from a wolf-like animal. The pictures included
prize bulldogs, St. Bernards, French poodles, tiny
Japanese dogs and great Danes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Florence, who has just had instruction in
evolution by her helpful big brother, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But a great many scientists no longer accept
natural selection and the survival of the fittest as an
explanation of development. There is the theory of
isolation, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “and I am one of those who believe
in natural selection only in part, but I wanted you
to hear it all. Florence, explain the effect of isolation
to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She explained it, and gave a very good example,
that of some birds in a species having stronger wings
than others, and so flying farther to nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I asked what any theory of the process of
evolution failed to explain, Ruth answered “immortality.”
I told her that evolutionary theories did not
attempt to explain that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I showed them how no theory explained change itself,
explained the initial variation. I showed them,
too, the limits of natural selection. When I took the
eye as an example of a specialized organ too complex
to be easily accounted for by natural selection, I
found them hard to convince, because they did not
realize the complexity of the eye. But when I spoke
of the life and death value of any organic change as
necessary for its selection, they saw how that limited
selection in many ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of the relation of evolution to our idea
of life. At once they said it was a proof of progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I insisted on its being a self-evolving, a will in
life. They saw that. Alfred said: “Could the one-celled
creature will; did it know enough?” Marian
answered that it was a subconscious will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “Within living things is the inner
will. But how about the earth? Isn’t there a will
outside for other things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered that even the earth seemed self-impelled;
that within the universe seemed to be an
immense will, and we were a part of that will; it was
our will within us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that creatures could change only because
they wanted to be different, because something wanted
to be different. I said to change, and to change always
in one direction, was progress; that what we
wanted to do, and thought we had done, was to find
that direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They saw at once how physical death was necessary
to race progress, how the old died to make room
for the young, and how each newborn creature had
new possibilities of progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when I spoke of all the progress of evolution,
of even struggle and selection leading toward harmony,
fitness and relationship, which is the thing we
want, Ruth said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how the lobster killing its fellows because
it had a larger claw could lead to harmony and
better relationship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a good point. But I scarcely had a
chance to answer it, for Marian said that creatures
had to develop themselves first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I spoke again, in this relation, of changing
standards of good and bad, how what was right for
an animal, for the lobster, for instance, was wrong
for us. I showed them how all animals were selfish,
and had to be selfish and self-evolving alone; how we
had to be unselfish only because we realized how
vast we were. Marian spoke again of the criminal.
She said: “If he were behind us, he, from his own
point of view, would not be bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he would have to be punished,” said Ruth,
“and made to be good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “for he is human, and we expect
human actions of him. But we would not dare
to blame him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said we would punish him not as a punishment
to hurt him, but to teach him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke again of diversity as necessary to comprehension,
to understanding. I told them I had a
whimsical fancy that the first one-celled creature divided
because it wanted company. If creatures never
divided, and became different, they certainly could
never understand each other. Marian said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see now. It is like a girl who had always lived
in her own family and developed pretty well there,
but the more different people she met the better she
would develop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “unlikeness gives us recognition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “If we were all one self, life would
be uninteresting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said I, “but we might reach a self-conscious
self which is unthinkable to us now. There is one
way, however, in which evolution helps us, and that
is such an obvious way that none of you has thought
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment they were puzzled. Then Alfred
said: “It is that we are really all one self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I see,” said Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “it is that we are all physically
related with all life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I went on to say that no one knew how life
began, that there were theories, but they might be
no better than fairy tales. They wanted to hear
some. I said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One theory is that life is eternal in the shape of
life-germs, or organic matter, and that these pass from
planet to planet throughout the ether forever. But
it is only a theory, and a doubtful one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like that theory,” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I thought beginnings concerned us no more
than ends, that all things, histories, science, knowledge,
theories concerned us only in so far as they
helped us to understand, as they served the large aim
of life and showed us how to go. I made Henry
repeat again that the aim of life was complete understanding.
I said: “To me it is like a measure by
which I measure and value all things.” We tried to
measure various things by it, such as the relative advancement
of monkeys, birds and ants, and the greatness
of Napoleon and Shakespeare. We came to few
conclusions, except that the love of man made man
lovable, and that Shakespeare must have been a lover
of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “I think he worked for his own
sake, and not for others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered; “but he loved and understood
his fellows, so he could not help serving them in
serving himself. It was his joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said if we had that standard of understanding
love, we would need no other morality. I quoted
from St. Augustine’s Confessions:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love God, and do as you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I said, “most of us do not love God, or the
great good, enough to be able to do as we please
without thinking. We still have to stop to measure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they were going home, I said: “Next week we
will speak of immortality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, this time?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, after this meeting,” said Marian, “I am
afraid you may tell us, what I have sometimes heard,
that we are immortal in the race. Will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “I will not.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='fifth'></a>FIFTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “I told some one lately about our
club and what we did, and he thought we spoke of
things that were too deep and philosophical.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think so?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered, “of course I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “We are doing something unusual for boys
and girls of your age. Most people would think you
not able to understand and enjoy it. But I know
you do, and you know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “Why should we not be able to talk
of these things in a club, when we certainly do talk
of them among ourselves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I read Henry’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day we spoke on the theory of evolution. The
theory tells us that we are descended from a single,
one-celled animal. This animal grew and was divided
into several cells, which in turn were divided.
We find that when a race of animals needs something
with which to protect itself, or with which to get
food, that thing usually grows, as in the case of the
mother bird, whose feathers are usually the color of
the place where she has her nest. In this manner the
one-celled animals may have developed, as the increasing
numbers made it harder to get food, and
brought other difficulties. Another way in which
species may develop is that of isolation. For example,
while a flock of birds is flying south to escape the
cold, some of the weaker ones are left on the way.
Here the cold may cause many feathers to grow, and
the other conditions may have such an effect as to
develop an entirely new kind of bird. We can also
take as an example the different colors of men, caused
by the conditions in which they live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The disappearance of certain species while others
survive is, according to the idea of natural selection,
only the survival of the fittest. We find that long
ago there were animals larger than any of to-day,
but they have completely died out, perhaps because
they could not find food, while the smaller, weaker
animals have survived because they were better fitted
for the conditions. Looking back at history, we can
see how at different periods one nation would wipe
out another which was weaker, or how one people,
more advanced than others, could better protect itself
from the elements, and, therefore, lived while others
died. The similarity of different animals gives a
good foundation for this theory. A baby will often
take attitudes exactly like those of a monkey, and
while it is young crawl on all fours like animals. Different
kinds of animals have bones and all other
parts of the body just alike, and also like those of
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This theory teaches progression and is therefore
useful. It teaches that we were once one, and we
should therefore have sympathy with one another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next read Florence’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In our last talk we spoke of evolution and its
bearing on progress. I shall simply try to give an
idea of what we said about evolution itself. By evolution
we mean that we all sprang from a common
ancestral source, and have gradually developed into
higher and different forms. In general, this change
has been from the greatest simplicity, which we find
in the one-celled animal, to the highest complexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Darwin, although not the first to advance the
theory of evolution, was the first to enlarge and further
it. His deductions rest on three main theories—heredity,
variation and natural selection. He thought
that the offspring always inherited the parents’ qualities
with something new in its composition. By
natural selection Darwin meant the survival of the
fittest, that is, that only the most fitted for life should
live. In this way the offspring receiving traits from
its parents, if they be to its advantage, will live and
continue them, and those who have not got them will
be killed. In other words, Darwin believed that the
terrible struggle for existence, which usually destroys
nine-tenths of each generation, must favor those who
possess the best variation for their environment; and
that these will in turn hand on to their successors
these favoring variations. In this next generation
the same process will be repeated, and in this way
we get a steady though very gradual advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day, however, looking at it broadly, we can
see that all heredity and variation need is some way
of separating those individuals having some peculiar
variation from those who do not possess any. This
we call isolation, and it can easily be seen that natural
selection is only a subhead under this title. Another
form of isolation beside natural selection is geographical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our theories have advanced to this stage, and although
it is quite a large move from the original ideas
of Darwin, there are many questions still puzzling
us, which have yet to be solved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came Marian’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On Sunday, November 1st, the Seekers held a
very interesting meeting. The subject we discussed
was Evolution. The very lowest form of life is a
one-celled animal. This divides into a two-celled
one, which in turn continues to divide and differentiate
until it takes the form of a plant or animal. All
animals must have had some common ancestor. The
proof of this is the existence of rudimentary organs,
such as the appendix in man and the bones in the
flipper of a whale where we should expect legs. Another
proof is to be found in the remains and knowledge
we have of prehistoric animals. Some of them
were shaped like reptiles, and yet had wings. In
connection with evolution, there are the theories of
<span class='it'>natural selection</span> and <span class='it'>isolation</span>. <span class='it'>Natural selection</span> is
the belief in the survival of the fittest. For instance,
if one lobster happened to grow a large claw, which
enabled it to fight better, its young were likely to
inherit this tendency, and their young also, etc., until
the larger-clawed lobsters, being better able to fight,
would kill off most of the others. This theory would
not always hold good, however. The theory of <span class='it'>isolation</span>
is very interesting. If, for instance, a bird of
one species was born with a longer bill than most of
the others, and this bird found a warmer climate was
better for it, and, after mating, flew farther south,
its young would probably inherit this longer bill, and
would also fly farther south than most of the species.
Soon they would become entirely separated from the
original species, and would become a new class of
birds. The connection that <span class='it'>Evolution</span> has with our
work is that evolution is progress and that our aim
is progress. Evolution also helps us to understand
animals and plants, and to come into a better understanding
with nature. Disease is the price of progress.
As we progress, one part goes ahead, often at
the expense of some other part. Thus disease may
be called the price of progress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian admitted that she was rather mixed up
about the cells dividing and the long-billed bird going
south for his health. But this is doing well for the
unscientific Marian, who said a while ago that she
did not see how science could have any effect on our
view of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I read Virginia’s paper:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>THEORY OF EVOLUTION</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first life that appeared on the earth was a
one-celled animal or plant that appeared beneath the
water. The germs of life travel through the ether,
and wherever there are conditions in which living
things can thrive, there they settle. So that was the
way in which life began on the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This one-celled animal, after a while, divided into
more cells, and thus became more complicated. When
land appeared, land animals and plants came into
existence. And these animals became higher and
higher. First the animals without a spine, then a
more complicated specimen, in the lower forms of
vertebrates. Then the reptiles, out of which came
two branches, the birds and the immense reptiles of
which none have survived that I know of. But out
of them came the mammals. And after many thousands
of years, man appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At first man was more like an animal, but after
centuries he became less savage. He made implements
for himself, and lived in tribes with his fellow
men; and the more highly civilized man becomes, the
more will he sympathize with the rest of mankind,
so that when the highest civilization arrives, it will
only mean complete love of all living things.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I insisted that the theory of germ transmission was
not a fact. I said she seemed to have avoided natural
selection, that I thought she did not like it because
it was too mathematical and too logical for her. Ruth
thought perhaps that was why she did not like it
much, either, though it interested her. I said: “It
seems at first so ‘cruel’ a theory; it repels us until
we remember that what is cruel in a man is not so
in a beast.” Virginia answered that she did not
think it cruel, because it was not meant cruelly. “They
had to kill each other,” she said. Henry asked me
whether I thought it cruel to eat animals. I answered
it was not cruel, unless they were cruelly killed. Ruth
added that some time we would get beyond the need
of eating animals. “To hunt for fun is wicked,”
said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “Perhaps we think natural selection
not so cruel among animals, because we did not do
the suffering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children all said they did not remember just
what relation evolution had to our idea of life. I
answered that the very fact that we could not go on
in our thought without it proved its relation, and that
we would constantly come back to it, that I did not
need to explain it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we spoke of prayer. I asked each one in
turn what and how much they had thought of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred said he had never thought of it, that he
had prayed as a baby, but had stopped early and
never felt the need. Florence said the same. Henry
said he believed in prayer, especially in prayer for
strength in any undertaking. “Of course,” he went
on, “I don’t expect to be helped against the other
fellow, but I get strength in praying for strength.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you,” said Ruth, “only don’t you
pray to know whether you are right or not? For you
might be wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I thought I might be wrong,” he answered,
“I wouldn’t be doing the thing I was doing.” They
argued it a bit. “But,” he went on, “I have no set
formula for prayer, nor a definite time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I have always prayed. When I
was little I got in the habit of saying a silly little
German prayer, so that I could not go to sleep without
saying something. So when the little prayer seemed
too silly to me, I began saying each evening the stanza
of a poem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What poem?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last stanza of the ‘Chambered Nautilus.’ I
could not go to sleep unless I said it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She recited it for us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “It depends on what you mean by
prayer. I never learned to say any, nor ever wanted
to, but I do have a prayer-feeling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all agreed that the prayer which asked for
something definite was folly. I said prayer was getting
into oneness with the vast Self around and
behind us, and drawing strength from that which
was ours for the asking, which <span class='it'>was</span> ourself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said it was getting into harmony with the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We thought every one had that feeling of vastness,
of oneness with God, at times. Virginia said
she got it especially when she was by the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel it most,” said Marian, “when I am out of
doors, and feel my close relation with nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said he felt it most in a big crowd of people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Ruth; “then you feel how little
all this is, and the vast, big life above it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean, Ruth,” I asked “that you feel
the crowd to be a little thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” she answered. “I feel it in the crowd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “To be among people always arouses
that feeling of sympathy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many ways of praying, I said; to speak
certain words that aroused in us the prayer-feeling
was a good way; but that the words were only to
awaken the feeling in us, and were worth nothing by
themselves. If one could feel the prayer without any
words whatever, it would be just as well. Florence
thought it very hard not to get to repeat words by
rote. Henry said he always made a particular effort
to think of the meaning of the words as he said
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe,” said Virginia, “that it is so much
thought as feeling. I don’t always think of the meaning
of those words when I say them, but I get from
them the feeling that I must have, to go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” I went on, “it seems especially important
to get into this frame of mind just before we go
to sleep. For during sleep it seems as if the bigger
self were working for us. And as we go to sleep,
so shall we be next day. I think that if, as you fall
asleep, you ask—your vast self—for strength, for
the power to do whatever you know you must do
next day, and to solve whatever problems you have
to solve, and then get the deep sense of prayer, you
usually awaken with the strength you need, and your
problems solved. Is it not so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said she always found that if she wanted
to learn something, she had only to read it over to
herself at night, without learning it, and in the morning,
when she awoke, she knew it. Ruth said she
found it so; that she always felt next day according
to the way she had fallen asleep at night. They had
various opinions. Marian said it did not matter
how she fell asleep at night; if things went well in
the morning, the whole day went well; if ill, then
the day went ill. She loves the power of each new
day. Alfred said he thought that our brains worked
for us in sleep, because then the mind was free from
all obstructing thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I repeated for them a little prayer I had written
for a baby:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Great Lord of life, who lives in me,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And lives in all I know,</p>
<p class='line0'>With happy thoughts I go to sleep;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And while I sleep I grow.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>“I hope to wake this coming morn</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;More strong, and brave and bright;</p>
<p class='line0'>While you shall stay, both night and day,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With all I love to-night.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>They said it did not seem babyish to them. Henry,
especially, liked it, and several of them wished to
copy it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said one might have the “prayer-feeling,” the
sense of the whole, so constantly that one would not
need to pray, that one’s whole life might be a prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children objected to this, because they thought
it would be impossible now, in our imperfect condition.
Virginia said: “A person who lived that way
would be a perfect saint.” Henry thought it would
make one cold and unsympathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is that possible,” I asked, “when it would
be a state of constant sympathy and understanding of
life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Ruth; “such a person would be too
much above us. I don’t think one could live so, at
present. It would imply a perfection physical and
mental that we have not yet reached.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said she not only thought such a state
possible, but she believed there were people who lived
in this way now, and that she knew such people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one suggested that they must be unspeakably
happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered Florence; “not necessarily happy,
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that I thought such a life would be a state
of happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all agreed; Florence, too, after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian and Henry said they had never met people
without limitations. Florence insisted she had;
whereupon Marian called her a hero-worshiper. I
said people’s limitations were where they failed to
understand, and that we none of us understood everything.
The sense of oneness would not imply, however,
either perfection or apartness or superiority.
One might feel everything in this way, whenever one
thought of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry answered: “But how often is one not occupied?
Little things distract us constantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “It means having always the sense
of oneness, sympathy and understanding, and always
acting, thinking and judging according to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said I, “and there is another thing that
seems to me a prayer. Every creative action; that is,
everything we do which brings us into relation with
the world, is a prayer because it is an expression of
oneness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “It seems as if there were two kinds
of prayer, one strength-giving and one strength-getting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I don’t know how we came upon the subject of
circles. I said that the smallest things, as well as
the largest, were prone to express themselves in a
universal way, that every drop of water naturally
formed itself into a sphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marian; “and the circle seems to stand
for all life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we spoke of immortality. I asked each to
tell me what he or she thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia did not want to express her opinion. Ruth
and Henry vaguely implied that they believed in immortality.
Alfred said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is very good for people, if they can
believe in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not the question,” said I. “I believe nothing
but the truth is truly good for people. What do
<span class='it'>you</span> believe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe I am immortal,” he answered, “because
I see no reason to believe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “We must be immortal, because
nothing dies, but is passed on. And there is something
in us—I mean that which loves and knows sympathy—which
we do not pass on. So I think it must
be immortal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “I am, so I don’t see how I could
not be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered them: “Marian’s and Florence’s ideas
seem to me very good. One cannot prove immortality.
I have good reasons to believe it. But my
best reason is not a reason at all; and if you don’t understand
it, I cannot explain it to you. If I am, I
must be forever. ‘I am’ means immortality. That
is what Marian said, and what I believe. If I believe
in the whole Self of the universe, and that
Self is in me, and I am in it, then how
can I die unless that Self dies? And if I believe
in progress, which is toward complete understanding
and wholeness of the Self, how can that
progress be without me who am a part of it? Do
you know who Robert Ingersoll was? Well, he, who
passed for such a scoffer—though in reality he expressed
only his own realization of his ignorance and
his contempt for dogmatic faiths—once said: ‘I am
a part of the world. Without me the world would
be incomplete. In this there is hope.’ Hope, he
meant, of eternal life with the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children were much impressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “How can one face the horrible
thought of extinction? It is unimaginable. What
answer would you give,” she asked, “to those people
who claim that we are immortal only in our children,
in the race? I never know what to answer them,
and yet I feel sure they are not right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think there are two good answers,” I said.
“First, it is extremely unlikely that the race is immortal.
Even if we thought our immortality unlikely,
it is far more likely, and much less of an act of faith,
to believe in it than to believe in race-immortality.
We know that every planet dies and parches. We
know that every race, every physical manifestation
comes to an end, but we know that the spirit of life
lives forever, and forever grows. I have heard people
say that when this planet dries and freezes, men will
have advanced so far in science that they will find
their way in airships to another planet. But to me
it seems far more unlikely than that the spirit of
life, the self within us, should go on forever. The
second answer seems to me to be Florence’s answer,
that we are not immortal in the race, that although
we give our children much, we give to no one our
power of love, of understanding, of sympathy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry asked: “Don’t we give it through example
and teaching?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We give much,” I said. “We can teach and
train, but we give no one that understanding self,
the power for love and sympathy, which is in us, and
cannot be made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry did not see how one could find satisfaction
in living for the race, since forever and ever each
successive generation would be mortal and would disappear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I did not believe that in a world which to
us was all intellect, the intellect could die. Then I
read aloud the following passage from “John Percyfield,”
by C. Hanford Henderson:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is an old mistake, that of calling desires beliefs.
But I think I have allowed for this. I have said, if
death end all, if that be the truth of it, then that is
what I want to believe. For no man in his right
senses wishes to be either self-deceived, or other-deceived.
I have doubted immortality, even disbelieved
it, but now I believe it on as strong warrant
as I have for any of my scientific beliefs. In one
sense, immortality cannot be experienced; it is not
a fact of experience in the same immediate way that
certain minor scientific facts are. But neither can the
paleozoic age be experienced, nor space, nor time, nor
cause and effect. They are inductions from experience.
And so to me is immortality. It is an induction
from experience. In a world where every reality
is essentially spiritual, or intellectual, whichever term
you prefer, where even the study of nature, as soon
as it passes from mere observation into orderly
science, becomes a mental rather than a physical fact,
I can only imagine the disappearance of spirit by
picturing the annihilation of the universe itself. Without
the mental part that we give to all of our so-called
facts, they would cease to exist. It is possible that
the universe does shrivel up in this way and disappear,
but it is less probable, I think, than any one of the
great possibilities which science rejects, and feels warranted
in accepting their opposite as fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that to me as to him it seemed as if, were
there not immortality for the self, the world itself
might shrivel up and disappear. A world without
immortality would be a mad world, without reason;
and, as everything else seems reasonable to me, I
believe the world to be reasonable. I spoke, too, of
the danger of believing things simply because we liked
them. I told them how I had disbelieved in immortality
at one time, because I suddenly found I had
only believed what pleased me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I believe things because I like
them. But may not that liking, that feeling, in itself
be a sign of truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered; “liking is no proof or sign.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “But it is only because we care, because
we wish to believe, that we begin to think of
these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I replied, “we must care. But then we must
bravely face the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian told us she had never been taught anything
on this subject, but that gradually her belief
had grown, and that her talks with Ruth had helped
her from her ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said many people believed in “personal” immortality;
that is, immortality with memory, and the
meeting of those we love. I do not pretend to know,
or to have a definite opinion. But I think the results
of life are eternal, even if not in precise memories.
I asked the children for opinions. None of them
seemed to believe, or care to believe, in distinct personal
immortality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said: “We would surely meet those we had
loved, in that complete whole self, even though it
were not as persons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was surprised and glad to hear her say it. I
had said to the children that they probably believed,
and might easily believe, much beyond what I told
them, but this was all which I believed; I would tell
them no theories or surmises of mine, of which I
could not feel certain. They were urgent in asking
me please to tell them some theories, but I refused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said she believed in transmigration. I
think it possible, as I told her; it is in every way consistent
with progress and all things in life, but I have
no reason for feeling sure of it. She said: “It must
be true, for if there is just so much spirit in the world,
forever and ever, and if it must express itself through
matter, how can there be anything but transmigration?
Some time we may all live again on some other
planet, in some other shape.” I said it might be so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children asked me whether I believed animals
were immortal. I answered that as much life and
self as is in them must be immortal. I observed that
this idea of animal-immortality was consistent with
Virginia’s belief in transmigration, that so each least
creature might rise through successive stages toward
its complete self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I said to the children that, of course, if we
believed we had been nothing before we were born,
we could easily believe in extinction. But I, for one,
believed, yes, knew, that I had been forever, that I
was not “made” in these few years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marian, “I could not have grown to
be what I am, just since I was born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “We are not concerned with the past,
but with the future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia, and the others, brought up instances of
seeming to remember things from a former life, of
feeling as if they had done some particular thing
before, in the dim past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred had not spoken at all during this time. He
now said he very much wished he could believe in
immortality, but could not see any reason for doing
so. I said we should have to spend the next meeting
in convincing Alfred. I went on: “If we believe
in the vast Self of life, and if we are a part of that
awakening Self, how can we die?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I read aloud Emily Brontë’s “Last Lines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was glad to leave the subject open in this fashion,
to give them a week for thought, and I said little
more.</p>

<div><h1><a id='sixth'></a>SIXTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I began by reading the children’s papers. Virginia
wrote the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people have the idea that to pray means to
fall upon one’s knees, fold one’s hands, lift one’s
eyes to heaven, and mutter some words one doesn’t
understand, sometimes in a foreign tongue. I don’t
agree with them. Unconscious prayer is the only
true prayer; at least, so I believe. In a great crisis
a man does not go on his knees, or, if he does, he is
not praying what he is saying, which is a mere parrot-cry.
His prayer is what he is thinking, and what is
in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many people say a prayer every night. In most
cases this is not a true prayer, but still it brings peace
and calmness, and it is lovely to be in a calm state
before going to sleep. I think the reason for this
is that the person who prays before going to sleep
thinks himself so virtuous that he is at peace with the
whole world. Then again, the person who goes to
church every time he commits a sin, and prays for
forgiveness, becomes careless of the wrong he does.
For can he not pray and be forgiven without the least
trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had a good laugh over Virginia’s idea of
prayer, which seemed to be chiefly her idea of other
people’s prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I read Henry’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every man must decide for himself whether or
not he shall pray, for no one else can tell him, since
it is a matter of feeling. If a man is relieved by
prayer, then let him pray; but if he only prays from
habit, he is doing wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must not expect that our prayers will be answered
by that superior power which we call God,
for this will only happen when we make up our minds
to gain our end, and put our heart and spirit in the
work. There is a saying, ‘God helps those who help
themselves.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people like to put their prayers in words,
while others like to think them and feel them. Still
others like to put out of their minds for a time all
earthly troubles, and just think of and feel that kindness
and sympathy for their fellow man; and to think
of the great spiritual questions which should have
such great influence on the lives of everybody, and in
this way let that spirit within them get complete control
of them, and that is their way of praying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one can say which way is the right way, but
if you do it in that way which does you the most
good, for you it will be the right way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said he thought kneeling, and the attitude
of prayer, were a “pretty” custom. They were the
attitude of supplication. I questioned whether the
best “prayer” was a supplication, said I did not like
the word “prayer” for that reason. Virginia said
she thought we often “felt” a supplication, even if we
did not pray nor expect an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian had tried to get the “prayer-feeling” each
night last week, but had not succeeded. She could
not get calm, but thought of everything under the sun,
and then fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “You can’t make your mind a
blank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered: “Making your mind a blank is not
prayer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry thought it good to consider our spiritual
problems just before going to sleep, and so get into
the right state of mind. Ruth agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I read Marian’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At a meeting of the Seekers on November 8th, we
discussed the subject of Prayer. Prayer is really a
feeling. When we feel truly in harmony with our
inner and our bigger self, the feeling we have is
prayer. Prayer can be made a source of strength.
If we find some way to get into the prayer-feeling
every day or at night, it will be a great help to us.
As we reached a conclusion on this subject very soon,
we began a discussion on Immortality, which we expect
to finish next week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we spoke of immortality. Although the six
of us believed in it, by trying to convince Alfred we
might gain much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked why, or whether, it was important to have
an opinion concerning immortality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said it was important for us to know, because
we were interested, because we cared so much.
I answered, that was one reason, and then there was
another. Ruth said the other reason was that we
acted according to our ideas of death, that it influenced
our morality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “we live according to our expectations.
Think of how the false or true ideas of
a future life influenced morality in ages past, of the
morals, good and bad, which sprang from the idea
of heaven and hell! Alfred, do you think it is important
to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said he, “it is important; but I can’t come
to any conclusion. I am not convinced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some people feel sure one cannot know anything
about immortality, and that therefore it is not worth
thinking of it at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “Because one does not know a thing
now is no reason why one should not try to find out.
And I believe we shall know, some time. If people
had felt so about other equally difficult things, we
would never have got on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “What is knowledge? We cannot <span class='it'>know</span>
immortality as an experience, through our senses; but
I believe we can <span class='it'>know</span> through our reason, just as
so much other scientific knowledge is a matter of
reason, of analogy, of deduction. It can’t be proved,
as one might prove that two and two are four. But
then I once read in a book that nothing could be
proved, except the things not worth proving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we saw a red rose, and we all called it a red
rose, there would be no doubt of its redness. But
if we differed, and some called it red, some pink, some
yellow, we should soon be in grave doubt. Our eyes
might be wrong. There have been so many opinions
regarding immortality, because people had different
‘eyes,’ that now we are full of doubts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of the time when the earth was thought
flat because it looked flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred said: “Immortality of what, do you
mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Immortality of everything,” I answered. “We
might, of course, believe that the universe will die,
will be extinct. But it is an unthinkable thought. We
all believe in something eternal. We know that force
does not die, but is changed and transmitted; we
know that no substance is destroyed; we know that
every action, every circumstance has endless consequences
and endless antecedents. They—and I—are
forever a part of the universe. How could we be
destroyed? Why should we think that everything is
immortal, excepting self, which seems the motive
force?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred said: “I don’t believe it is destroyed; but
it goes out of me, and that is the end of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others asked how Alfred could have agreed
with us all so far, and not agree now, since it seemed
to them that what we had said before, the idea of
progress, implied immortality. How could he believe
in the Self as God, the vast Self which comes
to complete understanding, and yet believe that he,
who was a part of it, that in him, and he in that,
could be utterly destroyed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said he believed new self was always coming
into the universe, and old self going out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where would it come from, where would it go?”
asked Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “There is nothing but the universe. Everything
is in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered that he believed in progress, progress
toward unity and understanding, but it passed from
one person to another; it would not be himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could the whole of Self be complete unless
you were there?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t believe it,” he said. “I don’t see how it
could be. It would not be myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not you, in any definite sense, but self, and
yourself in that. But it does not matter whether you
disagree, if you can really go onward with us, and
believe with us, without believing you are immortal.
For all that matters is how we live now. It is not
necessary to know the future, unless you need it for
the present. When I say ‘immortal’ I mean we are
immortal, now, because the universe is here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth thought that life would be meaningless if we
were not immortal; that all progress, all goodness
would have no sense. She said: “One might live
to do good, just to be kind to others, who were also
mortal. But if that were the end, there would be
no meaning in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry agreed with her, and most of the others
expressed similar ideas. I said this did not prove
we were immortal. But I, too, felt a limited life to
be meaningless. Still, I wanted to know the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred saw he could not consistently believe in race
immortality, but he wanted to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “You know the sun will burn down
some time. Every fire burns itself out. Then the
world will get cold and dark. And then what becomes
of the human race?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I said, “the energy that was the sun will
be in the universe, and will light other suns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Energy never dies,” said Virginia. “If I put out
my arm like this,” and she stretched forth her hand,
“the energy that goes out from me never dies. It
bounds and rebounds, and in some way goes on forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it has been forever until now,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I think it dies out,” said Alfred. “If you
bounce a ball, it bounds and rebounds and then stops.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I explained to him how energy is not destroyed,
but transmitted; how nothing is ever destroyed, but
all things are changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He believed the physical part changed and was not
destroyed. Still, it was not life any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said: “It is not the same thing. I am myself
now, but I am not the same person I was as a little
child. I am all changed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered him, “your body is different material,
your brain and your thoughts are not the same,
your shape is changed, but you are still self, and you
were self then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when I die, where will I be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” I said. “But I know that somehow
you must be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia and Alfred—in fact, all the children—had
a long discussion. Alfred said, in speaking of a
horse which had been buried in the woods, and over
which ferns had grown, “but the ferns were not the
horse”—a sensible remark. He said: “When you
move your hand, the energy that goes onward is not
the hand. And so, when I die, the self that goes out
of me may be a force, but it will go out of me, it will
not be I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you yourself,” I said, “are the life, the force,
the self, which goes forth, which moves all things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the children, being left to themselves, went
up into thin air. They argued the possibility of nothingness.
Virginia told how when she was a little
child she used to imagine what would happen if there
were no earth. They each described how they couldn’t
imagine nothing, and what happened when they tried.
Ruth told how one couldn’t imagine perfect unity
and understanding, either. I stopped them, and said
it made not the least difference in any fact whether
they could or couldn’t imagine it. Virginia, the little
artist and mystic, said she thought in childhood one
touched the truth unconsciously. The others all
denied this. I said it was a pleasant and comfortable
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I said there was one other interesting thing
I wanted to speak of, and that was memory. Most
people believe we remember nothing from before
birth. This is not true. Our whole body, our very
being, is a memory. Florence said: “It is a race
memory. Often we find it easy to do a thing we never
did before, because our ancestors did it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “instinct is a memory. The
fact that we are here at all, our minds, our thinking,
as well as our bodies, are a memory. We ourselves,
our present bodies, are a consequence of the lives
before us, a memory from the endless past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are what they lived,” said Ruth, “as our
bodies shall be what we live, not what we think on
the surface, but what we live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “but after a while we do live
our thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said life was a repetition with progress.
“But in the one-celled animal,” he asked, “was life
an expression of mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” I said; “but it seems to me self
or will must be at the bottom of all motion. I read
a theory lately, in an ‘evolution’ book, that was very
interesting. It is this: That consciousness or desire
is the source of all development, and that lower creatures
are conscious of acts which to us are automatic.
The lowest creature, which is a mere bag or stomach,
would then be conscious of itself, whereas in us the
consciousness of primal organs is swamped and lost
in our more intense nervous consciousness. Thus,
from the first, consciousness and will might be the
source of progress, as they are now.”<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>They all thought it a plausible and interesting
theory. Marian said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems likely. For do not babies have difficulty
in walking, and are conscious of every step, whereas
we do it almost automatically?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said; “it might be the same with the race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I insisted that one could know the truth in certain
directions, if one were willing to admit absolute ignorance
in others. I felt sure I was immortal, but I
had not the least idea how. I would not build up a
heaven, hell or universe of the dead, because all these
conjectures were likely to be false. I said one could
know much and learn more only by admitting one’s
limitations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course one could not know, I said, but I myself
did not believe in personal immortality with definite
memory. It might be so, or it might not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is not so,” said Marian, “for we remember
nothing definite from before birth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I said, “I feel sure that memory, the essence
of memory, will go on; just as our bodies and selves
are a memory, so whatever we are in this life will
have its consequences, and we will be forever according
to what we are now. All progress is a memory—and
a prophecy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke, too, of the endless stream of every least
action, how the least word, once spoken, is a spring
of eternal consequence, how each moment is tremendously
important. I reminded Marian how she had
once said school was so short, it did not much matter
what one did; and I had answered her, all life was
short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people think actions under certain conditions—in
foreign lands, for instance—do not count.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said she lived to enjoy herself, no matter
what death might be, but her enjoyment included
making others happy. I said, that was the only good
way to live, to enjoy oneself, and have a very big idea
of what enjoyment meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In talking we stumbled across difficult, confusing
words, “God,” “truth,” “eternity.” Ruth said: “We
ought to invent a new language, a code of symbols,
for everything in the old language has so many acquired
meanings, is so used up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have made almost a code of our own,” said
Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred had said nothing to let me know whether
or not he had been convinced of immortality. It will
be interesting to hear what he has thought during the
week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had now finished the first and fundamental
part of what we meant to do; we would now test
everything by that standard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is strange,” said Marian, “how everything we
have said has sprung from just one thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our idea of God,” <a id='she'></a>she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that, according to my prediction, we scarcely
found it necessary to use the word God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian answered: “It is because the word has
so many meanings, is so easily misunderstood. But
we know what we mean without saying it. My
Sunday-school teacher said God took a personal interest
in each one. I don’t believe that,” she went
on, “except as we are in ourselves, and take an interest
in ourselves. That idea of hers puts God, as
it were, outside and apart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I questioned Ruth concerning Christian Science.
She said our idea corresponded altogether with hers;
it was the application which would probably differ,
and we had not yet spoken of that. “We will do so
now,” I answered. I asked the others if they would
not like to have Ruth speak, in a meeting later on,
of Christian Science. They all said that they would
like it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next we will consider art, creative genius, in relation
to our idea. I was glad the children agreed
with me in preferring this to moral disputations. I
said I thought the longer we waited to speak of moral
questions, the larger view we would take of them. I
wanted to avoid pettiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our subject for next week grew naturally out of
this week’s talk. I said: “As a drop of water can
be a sphere as perfect as the suns and planets, so each
smallest thing, if it be perfect in itself, typifies the
universe. You must realize that in an infinite universe
there is really no such thing as size.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is only comparative size,” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered; “and it is with this idea in mind
that I wish to consider beauty, and the definite separate
creation. I shall want to know next week what
each of you means by beauty, or thinks beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian—thinking of the personal side immediately—said:
“I think it’s because most people are homely,
that we think some beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were amused at that. I said I did not mean
personal beauty in particular. Then they asked, did
I mean artistic beauty? I meant beauty in anything.
I would want to know what made certain things seem
beautiful to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I think there is nothing so beautiful
as taking a deep, deep breath. That brings beautiful
thoughts into my head, and makes everything
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This remark did not seem pertinent to any of us.
Virginia insisted, too, that she thought a man was
an artist, even if he could not express himself; that
to have artistic thoughts made one an artist. I answered,
it might be so; <a id='work'></a>work itself was not
good art unless it was a good expression, no matter
what the artist might be. Virginia explained: “I
mean an artist is more interesting than his work,
sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “A beautiful thing—in art—is a
complete thing, complete and perfect in itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so,” answered Virginia. “If you
were to sketch a tree—without finishing it at all—and
that sketch were your whole idea of the tree as
you saw it, then it would be no sketch, but a finished
picture. A thing is a sketch until you have altogether
expressed your idea. But then, no matter how sketchy
it may look, it is finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had to interpret Florence to Virginia. I said:
“Florence did not mean completeness in the sense of
exactness. She meant that the tree, no matter how
indicated, must seem to us so complete, in a world of
its own, as to leave nothing lacking or intruding;
that everything in the picture is there in relation to
the tree, and the whole makes a perfect little world.
If there were suggestions of other things which had
nothing to do with the tree, such as there always are
in life, it would not be a perfect picture. You said
it must be a complete expression of the artist’s
thought. That is just the completeness Florence
means. It must be a complete, self-sufficient harmonious
vision of a tree. And harmony means wholeness,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For instance,” said Florence, “even the smallest
and most trivial poem would be beautiful if it were
perfect in itself—and complete. Take Leigh Hunt’s
‘Jenny Kissed Me,’ such a little thing, and yet beautiful,
telling the delights of a kiss. And then take
‘Faust,’ which is much larger and deeper; and yet
each is perfect in its way, though ‘Faust’ expresses
so much more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you read ‘Faust’?” I answered her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, “but I know all about it.” <span class='it'>I</span> knew
that she had got her ideas ready-made from “brother
Arthur,” and I was amused. But I did not wish to be
hurried into the midst of my subject without beginning
at the beginning, so I cut the discussion as short
as might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “I don’t understand what they
mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told her she would understand when we had
talked it over, that I only wanted her, before next
week, to settle her own ideas as to what she thought
beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence repeated: “Beauty is completeness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Marian, “I begin to see what Florence
means by that. Like the drop of water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I like to suggest the subject for the following week
at the close of each meeting, and, if possible, to speak
enough of it to give them a starting-place for their
thoughts.</p>

<div><h1><a id='seventh'></a>SEVENTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth brought with her a “Christian Science”
prayer. I said I would read it aloud at the meeting
on Christian Science. One line in the prayer was,
“purified from the flesh.” Ruth guessed, before I
said anything, that I objected to this line. She believes
the body is “something to be overcome.” All
the others and myself disagreed with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I, who believe in endless progress, believe
the means themselves to be good and wonderful.
Unless this moment were good, nothing it led
to could be wholly good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said: “The body is something unreal, unessential,
which we do not keep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered: “We keep nothing but what we always
possessed, the power of growth.” Ruth says
we get certain new truths, and then keep them. She
tries to think that my idea and Christian Science agree
in every way, except that we use different language.
But she has doubts and qualms. Then we spoke of
“New Thought.” I said I thought most of what is
called so was unanswerably true, only there seemed
to be an enmity between “New Thought” and good
English. Marian agreed with me. She said she
could have no respect for a man who used poor
English. I would not say that, for I had received
too much information from men who did not know
how to give it. But, I said, I had often missed information
rather than rewrite a book for myself
mentally, before I could read it. Marian’s father
had read aloud to her, from a “New Thought” book,
this sentence: “The seen is unreal, and the unseen is
real.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe that,” she said. “Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered; “I believe everything is real,
the seen and the unseen. There is nothing but
reality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also said my chief objection to all these cults was
that they insisted too often on physical health as the
aim of life. Virginia said: “But just think, if we
had not to be concerned about our bodies any more,
if we were perfectly well, how much we could do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “that is true; but still it is
not an end, but only a means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was all before the meeting. Alfred had
come very early, as usual, and told me he “thought”
he believed as I did concerning immortality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I opened the meeting by reading Marian’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On Sunday, November 15th, the Seekers held a
regular meeting. Our discussion was on Immortality.
Most of us agreed that our self, our real or
inner self, is immortal. In the first place, if this
self in us and in every one should die there would be
nothing left, because that is the real, the life-giving
power. Moreover, if we were not immortal, what
would be the use of life? Some people argue that
we leave part of ourselves and the impressions of our
characters to other generations, and so on. However,
science has (almost) proved that the race is not immortal,
and at least, it is harder to believe that it is,
than to believe in the immortality of the real self.
Personally, I feel that my real self is immortal, and
that I will go on being. We do not attempt to picture
any future state. This discussion is the only
one in which we did not all agree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next I read Henry’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day we continued our talk on Immortality.
Immortality is entirely a matter of faith, but the different
ideas concerning it have influenced the fates of
nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mind realizes so much that it does not accomplish,
that it seems as though there must be a
continuance of spiritual action after what we call
death. If the spirit did not continue to exist, what
would be the purpose of our life? Some say our purpose
is to pave the walk of life for our descendants.
Indeed, we do want those who come after us to find
life pleasant and worth while living, but that alone
would not be a sufficient purpose, for why need there
be descendants? Why was there anybody in the beginning?
And besides this, we have more reason
to believe in the mortality of the race than for any
of our beliefs in regard to the soul. Science teaches
us that certain of the planets, which were once habitable,
are now no longer so. This may some day happen
to our planet, and then the race for which we
have worked will cease to be. Although we do live
for the race, we live more for the spirit. We have
already said that we are part of one great union. If
this is true there must be immortality, for when part
of the spirit ceased to be, there would no longer be
a great, perfect union.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said to Henry: “Your papers never begin as
if they were going to be right, but they end especially
well. You always keep the best for the last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we went on to our subject of beauty. What,
I asked, was the one truly beautiful perfect thing, the
thought of which gives us more delight than any
other?</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said—bit by bit—that it was complete understanding,
unity, sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I believed every beautiful thing was one
which symbolized this completeness, something that
in itself seemed complete and perfect and fulfilled.
It took some time to explain this. Florence, of
course, already understood it. Virginia and Marian
caught at it as a new and elusive and valuable idea.
All except Henry saw what I meant. Marian had
said, even before I expressed this idea, that beauty
was symmetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “I don’t see what you mean, or why
you need question it. A beautiful thing is one that
gives us a thrill of delight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “certainly. That is like saying
a thing is red because it has a red color. What
I want to know is why things delight us with their
beauty, so that we may make a standard from these,
whereby to judge all things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stopped them when they began to speak of special
works of art, because, I insisted, we would first
speak of beauty in all things in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “When I am in a field among
animals, playing with them all, that to me seems
beautiful. I do feel sympathy with them, but it
isn’t completeness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “and it isn’t beautiful, though
it is delightful in another way. Beauty is something
apart from us, which we see and hear, and which
wakes in us a sense of completeness, of harmony within
itself, as if <span class='it'>there</span> were the whole world, nothing
lacking, nor yet too much. A landscape, for instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is sometimes not beautiful at all,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “surely not. A landscape, no
matter how beautiful and wonderful, would be spoiled
by a big sign on the nearest tree, advertising ‘Babbitt’s
Soap.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or a sign ‘To Let,’” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “though that might not be as
bad, yet that, too, would be inharmonious, and suggest
all sorts of irrelevant things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Henry, “a burnt wood is harmonious,
I suppose, and yet it would be ugly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always,” said I, “not if it were blended into
the landscape, and mellowed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Henry answered, “perhaps not, if the colors
were beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if it were ugly,” I said, “it would be inharmonious.
A newly burnt forest suggests death and
desolation in the midst of life and summer—an incongruity.
It suggests destruction where the thought
is most unwelcome and horrible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Marian, “it is not the thing itself,
but the feeling which it gives us, that is beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “it gives us the thrill of that complete
joy. We seem to see something which is what
cannot be; complete harmony. The sight of the sea
makes Virginia feel so. And you, the out-of-doors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I have sometimes thought beauty
is light, because the sun is most beautiful—and, at
night, the moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said I, “if there were no shadows and no
darkness, sun and moon would not be beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then contrast?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “There must be contrast in all beautiful
things, because without contrast we could not have
completeness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, “in pictures it is so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A small thing,” I went on, “might symbolize completeness,
as well as a large one. A dog, in his way,
a beautiful Scotch collie, for instance, might be as
beautiful as a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We criticized, and found lacking, according to our
standard, the beauty of prize bulldogs; the teeth were
too suggestive of strife and biting, the spots unsymmetrical,
and so on. They spoke of many instances
of beauty in things, especially the beauty of
little children, and fitted them to this new standard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “A drop of water is so symmetrical
and harmonious, so beautiful in the sunshine; and
yet, on a dark day, on the sidewalk, it is not beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I explained even that. I showed her how a drop
on the sidewalk was not a drop, but a daub, how it
suggested all sorts of ugly and incongruous things.
“But,” I said, “if we take the trouble to look at a
drop hanging from anything, say from a leaf, we
shall always find it beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She agreed to that. Then she said: “Don’t you
think we sometimes do think of our own life as a
beautiful thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered. “There are moments when
our own life suddenly seems complete, when we feel
an artist’s delight in it, and for a while we, and the
whole world with us, seem to have reached what we
longed for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence asked: “Don’t you think it is usually
when we are having a very good, jolly time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian answered quickly: “No, not at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I understood what Marian meant, and did not attempt,
naturally, to explain it to the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we all agreed, every one of us, that completeness
and harmony were beauty. But the children
had started time and again to bring up instances
in art which to them seemed not to fit, and
which they thoroughly misunderstood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” I said, “that the beautiful thing is the
same as that which seems to us most true and good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said again that one idea seemed to cover
everything, and that we came to conclusions quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I will tell you,” I said, “what I mean by
art and the artist. In speaking of art here to-day I
mean not only painting—as one of you thought—but
everything which expresses beauty; poetry, the
novel and drama, sculpture, music, acting. You see
the difference between science and art?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Science gives us knowledge,” said Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “or, rather, science gives us
facts, truths, but never at all the complete truth. It
gives us parts as parts, never the whole. Philosophy,
on the other hand, does what we are doing here. It
reaches out for the complete whole, for understanding,
for unity, but it knows well that it can never
attain the end. It reaches out for the complete good,
and is satisfied with nothing less than that unattainable
whole. But art does another thing; it tells
us a lie—the most wonderful lie in the world—truer
than any truth. It says: Look, here is completeness,
harmony, wholeness, in this one small shape. And
we know it cannot be so, but still we feel it to be
there. That lie gives us, as no truth can, the thing
we long for, and know to be most true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what do you mean by the word genius?
What is genius?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Usually,” said Virginia, “a genius is a crank.
There is a girl in my art class who is the frousiest,
queerest crank in the world, and every one calls her
a genius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Geniuses are often queer,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said, too, that many geniuses were anything
but great and good in their private lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I answered, “I am surprised by your definition
of a genius. But perhaps you will be more
surprised, and sorry you said so much, when I tell
you that I consider every one of you a genius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my,” said Virginia, “how nice! I wish I
were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “What we usually call genius is but a
larger power of understanding, a sense of <a id='unity'></a>unity, of
the relations of things. And we all have that, in some
degree. So we all have genius. It is not a matter
of quality but of quantity. We are all the same stuff,
only some more and some less.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said I might use the word in that sense, but
he didn’t think it was the true meaning. He said:
“What definition is in the dictionary?” We had no
dictionary at hand, so I tried to prove my definition
true without a dictionary, and I succeeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “There is no gulf between the genius and
the stupid looker-on. Don’t you see why there could
not be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Marian; “it is because the looker-on
would have to have some genius, or else——” She
could not finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so, Marian,” I went on; “or else he could
not appreciate the artist’s work. It is the genius in
the onlooker that appreciates the genius in the artist.
And in so far as you can appreciate the genius of
Shakespeare, in so far you have the same sort of
genius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said she, “art makes us recognize ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “our bigger selves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So one might speak,” she said, “of a person developing
his genius for music, or his genius for painting,
and so on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered; “and you see how easily and
well one can use the word in that sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth asked: “If the great genius is really one who
understands better than the rest of us, and has a
more harmonious vision, how is it that so many
geniuses are incomplete and very imperfect in their
personal lives?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is,” I said, “for the same reason that
I gave you for disease in highly developed beings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Marian; “it is one part developed at
the expense of another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They wanted to know why so many artists were
peculiar, erratic, “Bohemian”—Marian used that
word. Virginia spoke again of the happy-go-lucky
people down at the art league.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I thought one reason for this manner among
artists was that, as they were always looking for
the new, the beautiful—which is ever new—they had
no patience with so-called respectable people, who
clung to old things because they were old, and so
these artists often purposely went to the other extreme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “You must see that there is the tendency
in all of us to make of life a work of art, to live a
complete, beautiful life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know some people,” said Virginia, “whose lives
do not seem to me in the least artistic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be,” I answered, “but the tendency is
there to make of life a complete expression.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t all I mean,” said Marian. “I want
to know what is meant by the artistic temperament.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is in great part,” I said, “a fiction and a false
generalization. Many experts have not the artistic
temperament, and many not-artists have it. As for
artists going astray more often than others, if that
be true—which I doubt—there’s a good reason for
it. Artists are always very sensitive—naturally—and
so, unless they are very strong-willed, too, they
will be more easily swayed by outside events and
their impressions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe every one has genius,” Virginia
said. “I know some people who are perfectly stupid,
and don’t understand anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is scarcely possible,” I answered, “if they
are human beings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say,” asked Henry, “that you
know any utterly selfish person?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she answered; “or, at least, people who are
not interested in anything worth while outside themselves;
people who can walk through an art gallery
and not look at the pictures; who love nothing beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may be one of those,” said Ruth, “for I do not
care for pictures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One’s genius might not be developed in that particular
direction,” I said; “none of us are developed
in all directions. But grant, at least, Virginia, that
your most stupid people have undeveloped genius
which might be awakened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because if you don’t,” I answered, “I shall think
your understanding of those people is very limited.
Genius does not necessarily show itself in relation to
art, to the sense of beauty. Genius is in the understanding
a man must have to be a man. How could
he have any relations with his fellows, any intercourse
without some understanding?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is one essential difference between the
genius of the looker-on and the genius of the artist;
it is that the artist creates, that he must have talent.
No matter how much genius a man may have, if he
does not or cannot express his genius, he is not an
artist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think,” asked Marian, “that an artist
knows himself to be a great genius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” I answered her, “that no man ever does
a great thing unless he first believes he can do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember, I once said that to understand
life well one must be creative, one must do things,
because life is forever creating. And so the genius
who is an artist, who has talent, who creates, by that
very creation understands better than other men. He
who can draw a thing sees it better than he who
cannot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Virginia, “the fact that he can draw
it proves that he sees it better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in learning to draw it,” I went on, “he came
to see it better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The great artist,” said Henry, “is one who expresses
his idea perfectly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” Virginia said, “I wonder if I will ever
get to be a great artist. For the thing I draw is
never the thing that was in my mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said I, “you see the distinction between
genius and talent. Genius is the power of understanding.
Talent is the power of expression. A man
may have very little to say, and yet say it wonderfully
well. And another man may have much to say,
and marvellous understanding of life, but not nearly
so great power of expression. That is what Florence
meant the other day, when she spoke of ‘Jenny Kissed
Me,’ and of ‘Faust.’ But the man who expresses
even the smallest thing well understands, at least,
that thing. The power of expression itself implies
understanding and a sense of unity and harmony.
For no matter how well a man may be able to draw
lines and objects, unless he understands composition—which
is the knowledge of harmony and completeness—he
cannot paint a good picture. And no matter
how well a man may write English, however
perfect his style may be, unless he understands something
of life, of symmetry and structure, he cannot
write a good book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “Poe expressed himself very well.
Was he a genius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, stop,” I answered. “Don’t ask, ‘Was he
a genius?’ Of course, he was that. We all have
genius. The question is, how much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me,” said Henry, “that in some way
Poe was as great as Shakespeare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “in some ways; and that is a very
good example. Poe’s power of expression may have
been as great in some ways as Shakespeare’s. But
just think how immeasurably greater was Shakespeare’s
genius, his understanding, and grasp of life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poe, for instance,” said Henry, “was a great
mathematician, and used his deductions in his stories.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others told Henry this had nothing to do with
his genius. They had a long talk on the relative
genius—that is, understanding of life—of Poe and
Hawthorne, and brought up many instances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “Was Milton a great genius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose he was,” she said, “but I don’t think
he had a great understanding of human life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you read ‘Paradise Lost’?” I asked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you must have noticed his wonderful sympathy
with, and understanding of, the devil himself.
He saw the tremendous contrasts of life, and understood
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must read that,” said Virginia, “if he wrote
with understanding sympathy of the devil. Don’t
you think,” she asked, “that those who write books
for children generally understand life very well, and
have true genius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” I said. “What do you think? How
about those artists who write for children in the
Sunday comic papers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I spoke of the artist in us all, who sees
things ever as distinct wholes, who picks out, as he
goes through life, complete visions of beauty to reproduce
in his mind. These visions have to be distant,
separate from himself. For life is so distracting
and full of contradictory passions, so vast, and,
as we know it in our limited lives, so incomplete, that
we must get rid of it, we must separate ourselves,
with our universal and unfinished relations, from the
perfect and whole beauty which we wish to see in
the artistic vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have noticed,” I said, “and you have
often heard, that far-off things are most beautiful.
It is because our life, interwoven with endless distracting
circumstances, does not seem to touch those
far-off things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Autumn leaves,” said Marian, “far off look so
beautiful, and near by are full of imperfections.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “And perfection of detail in a picture,
as if the things were very near and real, does
not make it better. It does not seem good. You
know Millet’s ‘Sower,’ at the Metropolitan Museum:
when you go close, it is all streaks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This dimness of detail is for two reasons, in
most great pictures,” I said. “First, the artist often
paints a picture with the intention of having it looked
upon from a distance. Second, in the perfect whole,
detail is merged. All must blend and harmonize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never thought of that,” said Virginia. “The
too precise details in a picture attract a person’s attention,
and want to be looked at for their own sake,
and so break in on the harmony and wholeness of
the picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, just so,” I answered. I spoke again of the
sublime lie of art—the untruth which is most true.
I said: “I once had an English teacher who used to
tell us that in art one was not to give the truth, but
the impression of truth. Truths often break in and
destroy the impression of that whole truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I asked, “what is the one, the only object,
of art in the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We decided, all of us, that it was complete understanding
and sympathy. Art is a symbol of that completeness
for which our whole life longs. One of
them—I think it was Henry—said its aim was progress.
I said it was rather the picturing and prophecy
of the end and aim of progress itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had probably heard, I said, of “art for art’s
sake,” the cant of those who believed mere form and
expression to be the whole of art, and left out of
account the thing expressed. Virginia misunderstood
me to say: “Art for its own sake,” quite a different
thing. So, thinking I would agree with her, she
quoted, with disapproval, an article by Kenyon Cox,
saying: “He who worked for gold sold himself, and
he who worked for fame was utterly lost.” I said
I quite agreed with him; that unless one worked first
of all for the sake of expression, and the joy of it,
he was no artist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, meanwhile, his wife and children might be
starving,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is praiseworthy,” I said, “to support one’s
wife and children, but it has nothing to do with
art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said a man might well use his expression to
earn himself bread; that it was necessary and natural,
and had often even spurred a man on to work, but
that it could not be his first aim if he were an artist.
We spoke of Shakespeare, and of Goldsmith, and of
their writing under the stress of poverty. I pointed
out how, nevertheless, these men wrote of the things
they loved and understood, and how the joy of work
must have been their first aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke of play, and of art being like play; of the
old saying: “Work first, then play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said that was meant for little children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told them how scientists tried to explain play by
calling it a preparation for work. Virginia liked
that idea. I said that I thought work a preparation
for play, that play, interplay, the joy of creation, was
life itself. The children easily understood play in
this sense of the beloved work. Virginia said her
work was all play. I reminded her that she might
have to work hard, but she would do it gladly for the
sake of that play. Marian said her school-work was
almost always play. Ruth said: “I think play and
work are the same thing, and that we human beings
have made the distinction of words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Art cannot rightly have any object but whole representation,
but expression of the understanding of
life. I said that whenever art tried to be moral—which
was rather the business of philosophy—it lost
thereby; that whenever one took sides for a thing,
one took sides against something else, and had lost
the completeness and symmetry of art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said he thought art ought to teach a lesson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered: “Art ought to show us the whole of
life, which is beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia spoke of Dickens’ novels, and said she
thought those were best in which he wrote with an
object, and against an abuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered her that they were best and also worst.
They were best because he described in them the life
which he knew and loved. But the parts of these
very good novels which were directed against any
people or institutions were always bad, inartistic, incongruous.
As an example I quoted the dreary dissertations
on Chancery in “Bleak House,” and those
who had read it immediately agreed with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry and Virginia questioned me several times
concerning ugly pictures which were considered “good
art.” I told them that a subject not usually thought
beautiful, an old, old woman, for instance, might be
made beautiful by the artist’s insight. I did not
go into details, however, to-day. A great many
ugly pictures, such as the work of Teniers, Steen,
and others, seem to me very bad art. But now I
spoke to them of Wiertz, the Belgian, who seems
to me no artist at all, and concerning whom they had
both questioned me. I took as an example of bad
partisan art his picture of Napoleon in hell, with
crowds of poor people making faces at him, and pelting
him with brimstone. Such a subject in itself is
impossible to art. What could be more unintelligent,
petty, scattered and ugly!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said she did not see why an artist need understand
human nature especially well unless he was
one who treated of human nature; that a musician,
for instance, need not do so. I began my answer, but
gave way to a burst of enthusiasm from Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How, said he, could a musician not understand
human nature, he who knew how to rouse us to the
depths with his notes, who could move us to tears?
Surely he knew what he was doing, and the heart
which he stirred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said she did not see why Shakespeare showed
greater understanding or completeness in his work
than Emerson, for instance. Henry thought the
same. I tried to show them that Emerson in his
essays was not an artist—or, at least, not nearly so
much of an artist as a philosopher—that he strove
to reach the good, the complete harmony of the universe,
but that he did not give us the vision of a
present, finished, concrete beauty. They both maintained
that he did. Henry spoke of the essays on
“Friendship” and “Manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you read the essay on ‘Manners’?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, several times,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And doesn’t it give you a picture?” he asked.
Ruth added: “And the one on friendship. I seem
to see that friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I owned I did not feel so. I said it gave me an
inspiration, an ideal of conduct, not a picture. “Mind
you,” I said, “when I call Emerson more philosopher
than artist, I am not saying philosophy is less than
art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I understand that,” said Ruth, “but I, for
one, when I read Shakespeare, get not any especial
feeling of the completeness or whole understanding
of what I read. Emerson uplifts me much more, and
gives me power to do things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be,” I said. “You may rate either as
high or as low as you please, but their genius is different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pointed out, too, how in Emerson’s poetry, with
its rare, beautiful couplets, and its many lapses, the
genius and philosopher far outshone the man of
artistic talent. We had not time to go into detail,
or to quote largely, and I did not wish to speak much
of literary criticism and methods at this meeting, for
I had planned to do so at the next, so I think Henry
and Ruth went home unconvinced of the artistic
superiority of Shakespeare over Emerson. One might
almost as profitably argue who was a greater man,
Beethoven or Napoleon!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian asked me whether George Eliot was an
artist or a philosopher. I told her I thought she was
both, but that I believed she would have been more
of an artist had she been less a philosopher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked Alfred why he had kept so silent. Did
he agree with us?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “I do. It is very interesting. But
I don’t talk unless I disagree.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='eighth'></a>EIGHTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Henry came several days ago to tell me he would
be unable to attend this meeting, as he was going to
Washington. “I will think of the subject we were
going to discuss,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I opened the meeting with Marian’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At a meeting of the Seekers, held on November
22d, we discussed the relation which our previous
discussions had to Art. We set up a standard for
judging Art, and agreed that a good piece of Art is
one that makes us feel that unity and completeness
for which we are striving. Two things are necessary,
a good thought and good workmanship. We
also said that details in Art, particularly in painting,
are bad because they distract us, and we don’t see
the picture as a whole. I was very glad to have a
standard by which to judge Art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said to her that I hardly thought she could already
have that standard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, “but I am going to get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I read Virginia’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Art as it is connected with our previous discussions:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When an artist dies he leaves behind him all the
beautiful ideas he has put on his canvas, or in his
books. To be a true artist one must possess an idea
of the beautiful, and also be sympathetic with all his
fellow beings. Not only humans, but flowers and
beasts also. A person who possesses these qualities
is a genius. But to be an artist one must also have
talent. Either he must have a talent for writing,
music or painting, or he cannot express the genius
within himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This sympathy, this love, is something we cannot
explain. And so we call it the soul, because it is a
puzzle, and we do not know what it is. Everybody
possesses some of it, even the most heartless. It
may be the love of a plant or dumb animal, but still
it is love for a fellow creature. So all of us possess
genius, though few of us are artists.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next I read Alfred’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On Sunday, the 22d, we discussed the subject of
art. We said that for a thing to be high art it must
be pleasing to the eye or ear, and complete in itself;
that is, the artist or composer must so construct his
work that it will fully express some idea. In painting
a picture an artist may choose to convey some gruesome
idea, and do so perfectly, but that will not be
high art, because it will be displeasing to the eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may also be applied to books; if the author
tells something so well that it gives the reader a perfect
picture of the thought, the writing may be considered
a good one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I could tell by Alfred’s paper that he had
not grasped just what was the object of art. The
children repeated that it symbolized the unity for
which we longed. I asked, did they see why we took
up this subject of art at all, what it had to do with
religion? Marian had said, before the others came,
that it was the expression of our religion. Virginia
now used almost the same words, and Alfred, speaking
after her, said it in such a way as to make me
believe he understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I replied, this was true; art was the service of
religion, the expression of that sense of oneness with
the world which can speak only in creations, because
life is an endless creation. Beauty, I said, seemed
to me the perfect symbol of truth, of completeness
and symmetry. I quoted the lines from Keats:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is all</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The subject of beauty always puzzles me,” said
Ruth, “because beautiful things so often are not good.
Take the ocean, for instance. It is so beautiful; it
gives us above all things the sense of immensity and
harmony. And yet, think how cruel it is! Think
of the shipwrecks and the suffering!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not the ocean’s fault,” said Virginia. “That
is because we are adventurous and go out in ships.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “and we are willing to take
the chance and pay the price. But surely you do not
think of the ocean as cruel, as either good or bad.
Beauty is not in anything, but is in the vision of him
who beholds it. It is a momentary vision of the
completeness of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beauty is always a thing of moments. Don’t you
think so?” asked Marian. “It depends upon you.
At one time you may see a thing as beautiful, and at
another time not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is it,” she asked, “that some people cannot
appreciate beauty in one special form, either in music,
or painting, or poetry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Our senses are channels through which
we get the feeling of beauty. But no matter whence
the feeling comes, it is that same joy. One man finds
it in a picture, and another in a symphony, and another
in the woods. Do you know those two lines
by William Blake:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>‘Who knows but every bird that cleaves the air</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Is an immense world of delight closed by our senses five.’</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be other senses than ours which bring
the same message. Helen Keller hears and sees it
with her fingers in her world of darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throughout the centuries,” I went on, “in all beginnings
and primitive times, art was the expression
of religion. The first rude drawings were religious
symbols; drama and the dance and music were religious;
and all the oldest literature in the world, the
Vedas, the Bible, and the old Scandinavian myths
were religious books: the Greek drama, and—can
you think of others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They brought forth many instances; Marian mentioned
the English miracle plays, and Virginia spoke
of American Indian drawings, saying, however, that
they were more often used for communication. I
showed her how the first rude figures of animals, the
totems, for instance, were also used as religious symbols.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke, too, of the way in which art related us
with great minds in ages past. “Ruskin mentions
that,” said Ruth and Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is a one-sided relation,” I said, “for we
cannot speak to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we could,” answered Marian. “I so
often wish I could ask them questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We said again how hard it was, when asked, to
explain to outsiders the purpose of our club. Ruth
said: “When I try to tell people, they answer: ‘Oh,
yes, I suppose you just talk nonsense, and have a good
time.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said people wondered that she was willing
to stay in-doors on Sunday afternoons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I don’t tell any one of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I suggested to them that if one got a perfect standard
of beauty in art, it might be all one would need
as a moral standard to make one’s life beautiful in
the same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we spoke of the novel. I said I had noticed
that last week when I told them of completeness in
novels and plays, they seemed not to know just what
I meant. Florence said she knew. “It means,” she
said, “that every word and every person and every
incident must count. It must not be like life, where
distracting and unimportant things are always happening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so,” I answered. She had learned all that
from brother Arthur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went over it more explicitly, citing instances, and
then told them that we were all of us story-tellers,
in the sense that we tried to make every story complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In telling anything that has happened,” I said,
“we naturally leave out anything that has no effect
on the story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” added Florence, “we unconsciously make
up little details that help to fill out the story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Marian, “I think I must forgive some
one I know, who is always exaggerating.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know some one who does it all the time,” said
Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think that makes it right, though,” Ruth
protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “not right, but not wrong,
either. When we realize the artist’s tendency in us
all to turn everything into a story, first, we will not
judge people harshly for doing it, and, second, we
will be careful when we are trying to tell the truth,
not to allow ourselves to be cheated by the artist in
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Virginia, “people often miss-tell
an event, and get it all twisted, because they really
forget what was said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” answered Ruth, “one is not to blame
for forgetting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I think that most of us, unconsciously,
are story-tellers in both senses. Many of us are constantly
telling ourselves stories about ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said Ruth, Marian and Florence. They
gave me a hint of those wonderful romancings.
Marian is always beautiful in her stories, “as in a
real novel,” she said. Florence said she was always
as homely “as a mud fence,” but I could see by her
expression that none the less she was always triumphant.
Virginia in her stories was accomplished and
a great artist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I forgot to be one of them for a moment. I said:
“Until very lately I, too, used to tell myself stories
about myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I still do it,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the subject of unimportant details and characters,
we had a long talk. We spoke of Dickens’
many characters and interwoven stories, and Virginia
maintained that many had nothing to do with
the plot, that they were soon forgotten, and there
seemed to be no special reason for them. Marian
saw, however, that at times six or seven plots might
be woven into a single story. Instead of fitting the
standard to Dickens, they fitted Dickens to the standard,
and found, indeed, that “The Tale of Two
Cities,” which had least characters and distracting
stories, was most interesting, and well constructed.
Virginia spoke of “Lorna Doone,” and we all agreed
with her that the long descriptions of how things
were done—fishing, for instance—which the author
gave because he was interested in the country, and
which had nothing whatever to do with characters
and story, made it monotonous and almost spoiled
an otherwise delightful book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “He even tells what pattern of suit
he wore when he went fishing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found the same fault with Scott. Indeed,
none of them likes Scott. The criticisms were amusing.
His blonde heroines were always weak, his dark
ones strong, but none of them interesting. Ivanhoe
was a flabby nobody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of Shakespeare, of the part his clowns
played in the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “I see in what sense his plays are
complete, and I feel in him wonderful understanding
of men and great sympathy. But he doesn’t uplift
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to be uplifted into the lofty nothing?”
I asked. “Is not humanity good enough for
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke, too, of “Little Women,” a much beloved
book. We noticed how Louisa Alcott had
changed the story to make it a story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pointed out to them what it was that made melodrama;
namely, the intrusion of events coming from
without, not springing from the reaction of characters
upon one another, or the intrinsic situation—such
as robbers, marvellous rescues, or fortunes left
by distant relatives. We had a long talk on this
subject, and the children told many stories. But I
doubt whether all finally quite understood the distinction,
which is often hard to make. Is the coming
and going of the ships in “The Merchant of
Venice” melodramatic? I told them I should not
call it so, since it was bound up with the whole story,
almost like the persons. I said that the melodramatic
was more like life than the purely dramatic,
because in life, with its thousand relations, outside
events made changes constantly. But the story was
more true if it contained within itself its own complete
world, like a miniature universe. Each work
of art must represent the whole. “And this is why,”
I said, “in a really well-built play or novel, a trained
person usually can foretell the outcome. Suppose
that we knew everything in the universe, and all
the relations of all things to each other, we should
be able to foretell every event.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps that is why novels grow tiresome,” said
Ruth, “for we get to know just how they will end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke of the author leaving out his one-sided
moral verdict of his own story. After representing
life, the artist should not judge; first, because his
judgment is usually partial and incomplete, and
breaks the unity; second, because he thereby shows
lack of understanding and respect for his reader,
who might be trusted to draw his own conclusions.
Hawthorne’s stories are often spoiled by his moral
comment at the end. At this point I spoke of missing
Henry. I am certain he would not have agreed
as readily as the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said moral discussions were in place in books
on moral subjects, not in artistic works. I mentioned
especially the worth, ability and good influence of
the writers of so-called “muckraking” articles in the
magazines. Virginia waxed enthusiastic. She asked
why should Dickens not write of abuses in his novels,
when by so doing he actually brought about social
reforms? I said that for the social reformer they
were right, but not for the artist. I warned her not
to confuse the two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Marian spoke of Milton, and of his giving
up his artistic work for years to serve his country
in politics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One could not wish he had done otherwise. A
man’s life comes before art, before any other expression.
I said many of the “muckrakers” were men
who might have been artists, but who felt called to
work in this more direct way for the beauty of life,
because they could not tolerate its ugliness. But
they were not artists; they were something different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be so,” answered Virginia, “but just
the same I admire those brave, muckraking men
more than artists.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are often more admirable,” I said, “but
that does not make them artists. If you admire a
soldier more than a poet, that does not make him a
poet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They spoke of the reformers working for the
present, the artist for all time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Virginia, “the result of the reformer’s
work will last for all time, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke again of “for” and “against” in books,
of how we felt that writer to be the greatest who
understood and loved the villains as well as the
heroes, and saw the strength and weakness of both
alike. They all agreed to this, and quoted plenteous
incidents; among others, the outcast in “Bob, Son
of Battle,” which they had all read and loved. “How
I cried over him!” said Marian; and Ruth and Virginia
had cried, too. Here Alfred came in with his
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you cry over it?” asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered, “but I almost did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course not,” she said. “I forgot you are
a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wouldn’t dare admit it, even if he did,” I
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said she usually loved the bad characters
more than the good ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We saw how the false simplicity of villains and
heroes—as represented in the poor novel—of all
good and all bad, and their appropriate punishment
and reward, was untrue to life and human nature.
Surely, they said, all men had in them both good and
bad. Scott, they insisted, made this mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke of the psychological and the dramatic
methods in novels. I said to Marian:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“George Eliot, of whom you spoke the other day,
is an example of the psychological method.” I explained
the two methods to them, the one going into
minute details of motive and thought, the other suggesting
to us the motive and thought through the
action itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian does not like George Eliot. She greatly
prefers Dickens and Thackeray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I liked George Eliot, but still I preferred
the dramatic method for several reasons. I thought
that the passions, moods and changes of the soul
were too complicated ever to be put down by any
author so as to give the impression of truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth agreed with me, and said: “Perhaps that
is why I like plays better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To put down how a man would act under any
particular circumstances is much more convincing
than to tell how he would feel; for life always expresses
itself in creative action. I said: “A reader
likes to be trusted and understood by the author.
He would rather imagine the minute details of feeling
as part of the whole swing of action, to fill out
the picture for himself, to be recognized by the
author as a fellow genius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said novels tired her, because most novelists
had only three or four characters which they used
over and over again. I answered her that this was
because they wrote out of their own lives, and their
characters were usually but different sides of themselves.
I said many great painters used only few
models. Virginia said she had remarked that many
painters always painted faces that resembled themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point, just as I was beginning to speak of
wit and humor, Virginia’s brother came into the
room—in this case, for many reasons, an unavoidable
interruption. I had so far always kept these two
hours closed against all visitors. Although he sat
down in the adjoining room, and was warned to
listen and not to talk, his presence made them at
once self-conscious and superficial. I asked them
whether they knew any distinction between wit and
humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia answered: “I always think of a witty
person as one who has good thoughts and expresses
them cleverly, and of a humorous person as a boor
and booby, like that one in the next room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the laugh had passed, I said: “Virginia,
I can think of only one expression that will fit you
just now, and that is slang. I think you are talking——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through my hat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, exactly. This to me seems the difference
between wit and humor: The witty man is he who
says or writes clever, funny things, just to show how
clever and keen he is. Conceits are witty, because
wit is essentially conceited. It may be very interesting
and entertaining, but it always makes you think
of the author rather than of his characters. It is
always superficial, the trick of words, and it doesn’t
keep well through the ages. A pun, for instance, is
always witty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ough!” said Virginia, “not always!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bernard Shaw,” I said, “is a good example of
wit. Humor is the understanding of the petty foibles,
humors and lovable weaknesses of men. Remember
that the word humor really means mood or state
of the blood, that it is a word very like the word
‘human.’ Humor is always human. It is the large,
genial way of looking at life of him who sees how
little men are, and how great they are at the same
time. It is a sense of absurd contradictions, of the
unity of utterly unlike things, almost a parody of
completeness. All humor, all wit, everything funny
is an incongruous bringing together of things that
do not seem to belong together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” Marian said, “that is why we laugh
when we see some one fall in the street?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Virginia, “for their heads and the
sidewalk don’t belong together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, seriously,” asked Marian, “what makes me
want to laugh when I see any one fall, especially a
grown person? And I must laugh, especially if it
is a fat person, no matter how hard I may try to be
polite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s because you expect a grown person and
a fat person to be dignified, and to fall is very undignified.
Imagine his high hat flying one way, his
gold-headed cane another, and his heels in the air.
But if a little boy falls you don’t laugh, because little
boys are meant to fall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When my mother falls,” Ruth said, “I can’t keep
from laughing, though I hate to see her fall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But everything funny grows stale very soon,” said
Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is,” I answered, “because when we get used
to a combination it no longer seems incongruous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” asked Marian, “when you laugh at people
because they are boors and funny, why is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is,” I said, “because you feel yourself to
be so vastly superior.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” she asked. “I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And next time you want to laugh at any one,”
I said mock-seriously, “just think of it first, that
you are considering how superior you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed greatly impressed and quite cast down
by this remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Perhaps a good distinction to make between
wit and humor is that wit laughs at people
and humor laughs with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t satire wit?” asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought a moment. “Yes, surely,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I spoke again of the relation of beauty to our
subject, Ruth said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has all this about wit and humor to do
with our subject?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much,” I said, “except that it shows how
the spirit of fun has a part in harmony; and that it
shows humor to be understanding and a human thing.
But it is interesting for itself, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she answered, “it is very interesting.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='ninth'></a>NINTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth was unable to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a single paper this week! When all but Florence
and Marian had arrived without papers, I began
to be disappointed; but when they came in, I said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to give up the club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You should have seen Marian’s serious face.
“Why?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you haven’t brought me any paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all were too busy. But Florence had given
Henry a good little talk on the meeting he had
missed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked them whether they had enjoyed these
meetings on art as much as the first meetings. They
all said yes, quite as much. I spoke again of the relation
of our idea to art. It seemed to them all that
art was the expression of the religious ideal. Virginia
said: “It relates us with others and gives us
sympathy.” Henry said it was the action of religious
feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as,” he added, “it is said one knows a man
by his actions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what I mean,” said I; “it might be
well expressed in a single phrase that would stay in
your minds. Art is the symbol of completeness. It
must be in itself a tiny world, a miniature universe.
Do you remember the delight you used to get when
you were little, from a tiny doll’s house, from a little
thing that seemed real, that seemed a small, perfect
world in itself? This joy you get from every work
of art, the joy of a complete world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As in the novel,” said Marian, “which is not like
real life, with its incompleteness and distraction, but
has within itself all the people and all the things
necessary to itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke again of the way in which I meant to discuss
questions of conduct according to the rules of
art. I said: “Life can be made beautiful and complete
in the same way, and by learning these large
laws we may avoid the pettiness of moral discussion.
You, being a self, are the symbol of the whole Self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I continued, “we will speak of poetry,
of painting, of all the arts, and you will see that the
laws of all are the same laws. What is the difference
between prose and poetry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They mentioned various differences, such as subject-matter,
form, manner of treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The chief difference between prose and poetry,”
I said, “is that poetry is written in poetry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That seemed an evident difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Metre, rhyme, musical measure of the words are
qualities of poetry alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But all poetry doesn’t rhyme,” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “but all poetry has metre. Tell
me another difference. In what way does poetry
affect you differently from prose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what you mean,” said Florence. “You
mean because it has metaphor and simile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, too, but something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian answered, with some hesitation: “Poetry
is emotional. It stirs your feelings more than prose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I meant,” I said; “it resembles
music because it stirs you as much by the sound as
by the sense. And just because it is more unreal and
distant, it seems more real and close and complete
in its grip. A thing must be far off to give us the
sense of completeness and beauty. Music is to me
the art of arts, because it expresses everything and
defines nothing; because it is like life itself, rather
than a description of life.” Henry assented enthusiastically.
I went on: “You spoke of metaphor
and simile. We find it not only in all poetry, but in
all prose. And what is it but the relationing of
things to one another, the likeness and the bond between
things unlike? And so keen is it, so natural,
so close to us, that we use it every day, we are poets
every moment in this respect, for we hardly ever
speak without using metaphor. We say a sharp look,
a piercing look, and so use metaphor. Do you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “When we say in school, for instance,
that our teacher looked daggers, we are using
metaphor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “and even slang is often good
metaphor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred asked: “If you call a person a lemon, is
that metaphorical?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” I said; “but I think it would hardly do
in poetry, because it is too unsympathetic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about 23 skidoo?” asked Virginia. “Is
that simile or metaphor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said I, “is less metaphor than nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that in the modern play, which could not
use the figurative language of poetry, the metaphor
and simile were replaced by the symbol. I could not
go into this, however, as none of them, except Florence,
had read any modern plays. So I spoke of
the fairy story, and how it often stood for something
which was not itself. “Yes, like Brandt,” said Florence.
I did not dwell on this point, but went on to
the subject of taking sides in poetry. I said that
good poetry could not possibly take sides; that all
didactic and party poetry was poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see that,” answered Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Florence, “he wouldn’t let me convince
him of it the other day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry went on: “Take Whittier’s war-time
poems; they were written with a purpose and taking
sides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I don’t consider Whittier a great poet.
But that’s not the point. His war-time poems are
some of them good, perhaps, but the best are not
partisan. A man may sing of freedom, and still not
be partisan, as a man may sing of his native land,
and need not therefore say mean things of his neighbor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me,” said Henry, “that every work
of art should have a purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” I answered. “I never said it should not
have a purpose. I said it should not take sides.
Every work of art has the purpose of being beautiful,
complete and true. So I suppose you might say
that art is against ugliness. But ugliness is only a
discord, a false vision which art overcomes with its
beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand,” said Henry. “You mean one
might be for something without being against anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “one can be for completeness, for
unity, for beauty, which includes all things. An
artist pictures life; in telling a story he may see that
some things lead to ruin and some to happiness, but
he will not say he is for some and against others.
He will stand far above them and see them all as
they are, he will love them all, he will create a complete
and individual world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I suppose you don’t consider
Burns a great poet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do,” I answered, “except in his didactic
poems.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said, “‘Scots wha’ ha’ wi’ Wallace
bled’ is partisan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “it is martial, but it gives the
foe his due. ‘Break proud Edward’s power.’ That,
it seems to me, is a tribute to Edward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first they dissented, but finally agreed with me
that most martial poems—all great ones—give the
enemy his due. Marian spoke, in this relation, of
Homer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We considered high-falutin style and books that
are all climax, without rhythm and reservations of
strength, unlike life, which is all heartbeats and pulsations.
Florence told of a book which had “six
climaxes on every page.” I spoke of the conventional
phrases which mar style, because we feel them
to be imitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not original,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered; “and originality simply means
truth in the writer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We feel,” said Virginia, “that he didn’t take the
trouble to think for himself.” Then she spoke of
having been made, in school, to compare the like
thoughts of different authors, and asked whether their
being alike made them less original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “for two might see life in the
same way, each for himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on to speak of music. “To me,” I said,
“it seems the most perfect of arts, because it is in
itself harmony, the very word we associate with this
idea of completeness. I don’t know much of the
laws of musical composition, but I know they are
the laws of rhythm and harmony, the laws of all
motion. Of course, it is figurative to speak of the
music of the stars, and yet in a sense their motion is
music, because it follows the laws of music. Music
is the least definite of all arts, yet the most real and
near. It arouses our emotions as nothing else can
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of them felt as I, that music was most gripping
in its effects. Marian, however, did not, since
she is not at all musical. I spoke of words and intellectual
ideas in relation to music. Virginia said it
made her feel glad to hear music, that she had to
beat time. The others all enjoy music most when it
has a literary annotation, either in opera, or in concerts
with verbal explanations. At least they want
to know the name of every melody. In this I said
I agreed with them, because knowing the name immediately
put me into the mood the composer wished,
and saved me those first five minutes of uncertainty
which every strange music awakens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “When I learn a new piece on the
piano my teacher and I always talk it over. I have
a piece called ‘Spring in the Wood.’ We say, ‘Now
we are in the border of the wood, now we hear the
water rippling far off, now there are the ferns at
the edge.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I explained to them the point of interest, the point
around which all other lines, colors and interests
must centre, to which all are made subordinate. Virginia
said: “But it need not be in the centre of the
picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “it had better not, since that
would be monotonous and stiff. But wherever it is,
it makes itself a centre, and makes the picture a complete
whole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia told of the plan of completing the central
figure in a sketch, and leaving the rest unfinished—as
a substitute, as I showed her, for the effectiveness
of color. All eyes should be directed to
the central figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went into technical details of lines, angles and
motion, with help from Virginia, to show how color
might express mood and action, as well as did the
figures, and so would make the whole harmonious.
Virginia spoke of “curly clouds” in a picture of a
burial, made at the art school, where the lines of the
clouds were too gay, and spoiled the solemn effect
of vertical lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From balance of line we went on to balance of
light and shade and color. First I explained to them—what
most of them knew—the complementary colors,
and the cycle of color; that a picture containing
blue and orange, or green and red, has within itself
all the color there is. Think of the hideousness of
a blue and yellow or red and blue picture! “It would
have to be toned down with the third color,” said
Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke of the literary intrusion into painting, of
the necessity of a complete idea in the picture itself;
the difference between illustration and art. A picture
may have an illustrative name, but if it be complete,
beautiful and satisfying without any name, it is not
illustration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What is excellent craftsmanship might be bad art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia and Marian spoke of some pictures in
the Metropolitan Museum, which they had been told
to admire, and could not; some of them pictures by
Meissonnier, in which satins, silks and velvets were
done to perfection. Henry spoke, too, of certain pictures
of German monasteries which were painted for
the purpose of picturing the life, with precise detail,
and were not beautiful. I told them of the difference
between art and craft. Art is a complete expression
of life by one man. Craft is part of a big
completeness, the work of one man which has a purpose
in relation to the work of others; as a craftsman
may make the cornice in a palace which an artist
designed. The craftsman does a part, the artist
plans the whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “Sometimes some one says to me,
‘that picture is perfectly beautiful,’ and I can’t see
it so. Then again I may think a picture beautiful,
and another person will not. Why is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” I said, “your taste, your standard, is
different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it just taste?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taste with a reason,” I said, “even if you don’t
know the reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Virginia, “that when an artist expresses
himself well, every one must realize it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” I said. “One has to be trained to
understand pictures, as one has to be trained to see.”
I told them of Turner, whose pictures look beautiful
to some, and to others are mere blotches of color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A picture is not what it represents,” I said. “One
must learn to see it. A proof of this is that babies,
quite able to recognize objects, do not recognize pictures.
And so some people are babies all their lives
in relation to art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I asked, “do any of you think photographs
artistic?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe Henry was going to say he did, but was
overwhelmed by the others. Alfred said: “In a
photograph all the unimportant things are there with
the important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said that there, as in life, there was intrusion
of inharmonious details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The out-of-focus and blurred photograph sometimes
is artistic, because of the lost details and the
effect of distance; but, just therefore, it is untrue to
fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said photographic art was bad art. She
said: “My teacher gave a good example. If a fire-engine
were tearing along the street, you would be
so interested in that you would see nothing else.
There might be crowds of people, but you would
not notice them. But if a camera were to be snapped,
they would all be in it and obscure the engine. You
see only what is important, but the camera sees
everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a good illustration,” I said. “And so
you see we are story-tellers in vision as well as in
narrative. We see things complete and dramatic,
whether they are so or not, just as we must tell a complete
story. Do you realize how all the arts are related,
how they all have the same laws? And these,
I believe, are the laws of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever think of it, that the artist sees only
with his eyes, whereas you see with your eyes, fingers,
ears, with all your senses? You see a table square,
high, hard, smooth, but an artist sees it only in perspective,
from a certain point of view. To get completeness
you must limit yourself, because you cannot
see the universe. The drop of water is most complete
and perfect when it is a limited, spherical drop,
not when it is scattered abroad in mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The artist,” I said, “is one who sees things beautiful,
even when to others they do not seem so; and
to see things beautiful is to see truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of the children disputed this much-disputed
fact—for to youth it is obvious—so I myself had to
answer the objections. I said: “One might say that
in life many things are ugly, and these things are true,
therefore to see these things as beautiful is not to see
them truly. But we believe that the whole universe,
altogether, could we know it, would be harmonious
and beautiful; therefore to see things as beautiful
is to see them in relation to that truth, and as symbols
of that truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “We must believe that the whole
universe is harmonious; anything else is unthinkable.
We feel it in ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean, because we have the laws of harmony
in our own nature?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. The whole must be harmonious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of instances in which ugly things could
be seen as beautiful. The empty lot across the street,
with its boards, rubbish and shanties, is ugly; but at
times, under certain conditions, and by shutting out
a part with my hand, I see it as a beautiful wild
landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “Near us are some poor, ugly
houses, that I hate to see; but sometimes I see little
children at the windows, who are so sweet and graceful
they make the houses look beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are a great many pictures,” said Virginia,
“but I think there is not much art. Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I said. “To be a painter does not make
one an artist. Do you remember hearing people make
the criticism that a picture was pretty, but not beautiful?
Prettiness in art is a sad fault, one that perhaps
you, too, have found. But do you know just
what it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said she had often seen pictures that were
just pretty, without character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “When a painter makes pictures to please
the taste of people whose taste he does not respect,
when a would-be artist works to catch applause or
money from the crowd by satisfying their bad taste,
and does not even believe in the love of truth and
beauty which sleeps in them all, then the thing he
paints is usually pretty. He will paint a little child
with a kitten in her lap, because that is a pretty subject,
but it will be the most affected child and the
posiest kitten!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is superficial,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, for he does not know the true character of
those for whom he works, nor care to know his subject.
The smirking advertisements one sees are a
good example of prettiness. But many artists, working
for money alone, fall into this cheap, easy habit
of pleasing the worst taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you call ‘The Vicar of Wakefield’ a
pretty book?” asked Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed,” I answered; “it is far too genuine
and lifelike to be merely pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry insisted it was written for money, and was
merely sweet and pleasing. The others disagreed
with him so strenuously, I had hardly a chance to say,
as before, that one might write for money the thing
needful to be said. Virginia asked whether I did not
think Jessie Wilcox Smith’s drawings merely pretty?
I said I thought them so now and then, but that sometimes
her deep love and understanding of childhood
made them shine with loveliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “Some people are merely pretty and
uninteresting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Often,” I answered, “they want just that. They
look for superficial admiration, and show only their
superficial prettiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, of course, that isn’t art,” said Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes it is,” answered Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke of sculpture as the Greek drama of visual
art, a metaphor that appealed to those of them—Florence,
Marian, Henry—who knew enough of
Greek drama, with its masks and buskins, and its far-offness,
to understand. The distance, the unlifelikeness
of the material, is its charm. The colored
German marbles lose artistic beauty in gaining lifelike
color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case,” said Alfred, “I should think the
process of coloring and the newness of the material
would interest one so much as to draw one’s attention
away from the statue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think it is only that,” I answered; “for
surely wax works, which are quite common, with all
their lifelike color and softness, do not give us the
thrill of reality and beauty that we get from a marble
statue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Henry, “it is just the coldness and
hardness of marble, changed by the artist into shapes
of life and warmth, that make it beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “exactly. The sculptor expresses
his idea in every curve of the human form, and makes
human shapes say universal things. They express by
attitude and line power, beauty, tenderness. In the
‘Mercury,’ the lines of that headlong figure, to half-shut
eyes, represent the curve and angle of flight
itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia now spoke of Michael Angelo, and his
misdrawing of figures, which are none the less beautiful
and powerful. I said he was so great a genius
that his genius, as often happens, overshadowed his
shortcomings as a craftsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here we came, I know not how, on the subject of
drama. I said that to me it could never seem a perfect
form of art—that is, the acted drama—because
the actors usually obtruded their personality, and so
broke in on the unity of expression—the creation of
one mind—necessary to art. But the children, better
at the art of looking on than I, and not so quick to
note the significance of personality, said they forgot
entirely the actors themselves, and felt as though
the thing were a piece of life.   Virginia and Florence
said they felt as if they were the author, as if by
being spectators they took part, and Virginia said
she always did hate the villains!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of architecture we observed that it appealed directly
to the emotions, like music; that it made us feel,
we knew not why, glad or sad, or calm or overawed.
Virginia spoke of the Palais de Justice in Brussels,
which made her feel very tiny; and this naturally
brought us to speak of the feeling of reverence and
awe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whenever we feel small,” I said, “and see another
thing as vast, that vastness is in our minds, it is
our own immense other self which overawes us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said they did not know what the feeling
was. Virginia said: “When I have it, if I try to
think of what it is, it is already gone. But the next
time I see the same thing, perhaps some beautiful
picture, that feeling is there again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia and Florence said they never had any
reverence for particular people, because they were
older, for instance. But, I said, at least they must
have reverence for people, as such, for the self in all
people. They granted that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of the completeness of that architecture
which showed outwardly its inner use, and the spirit
of its land and people; of distinctly American problems,
the skyscraper, the selfishness of New York
builders, who did not consider the beauty of the
whole city, and so wrought ugliness. The children
gave examples, and did not agree with me altogether,
Henry saying that a railroad station built like a
Roman temple made you feel like travelling more than
did the gloomy Grand Central. When he asked me
how about the banks built like Greek temples, I said
that might be more appropriate, since some of us
did worship money!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke of the library at Washington as fitting
exactly to its use; its big, comfortable rooms made
one feel like studying and reading all the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if anything could make me feel like
that!” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the others had left, I took a walk with
Alfred. He said: “I didn’t exactly understand what
you meant by my being big when I feel little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant,” I said, “that when you feel awe before
the immensity of the universe, under the stars, or
by the sea, the thought of immensity is in yourself,
and it is really yourself who become immense. You
realize your whole self. And before that realization
your daily life and thoughts and your own small
self seem very tiny. It is one part of yourself, the
small part, standing in awe and wonder before that
other immense self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He understood that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on: “I only mentioned it to-day, and did
not expect you to understand. I often do this, either
to give a suggestion for the next week, or else to see
what really interests you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is a good idea,” he said.</p>

<div><h1><a id='tenth'></a>TENTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia could not come. We did have six present,
however, as we had a visitor, Leo, a boy of
sixteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth brought with her a box of candy, given her
by a sympathetic aunt, who has an opinion, I surmise,
of our club. They all assured me that candy would
not disturb their thoughts. Marian said: “There’s
nothing I can’t do, and eat candy at the same time.”
I do, myself, think it was an improvement. We had
a lively and interesting meeting, and much sweetness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian wrote a paper on our meeting of two weeks
past, following the notes I had made for Florence
to use in her talk with Henry. It lacked Marian’s
usual originality, as it was built directly on my
thought. She even used one phrase of mine, word
for word, namely: “Life proves all things by creative
action.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you use it?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” she said, “I didn’t understand what
it meant, and I wanted to ask you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad,” I said, “for it is a thing of which
I meant to speak to-day. All action is creation and
self-expression; everything is changing and in action
all the time, because it is striving to come into better
relation with all other things. All art and all life is
self-expression and action at every moment. We
must create if we would be complete. That is why
I love the active and creative life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marian, “I understand. You had
told us so before. But I didn’t know it was what
you meant by that sentence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I read Marian’s paper for this week:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On December 6th the Seekers held a meeting, in
which we continued our discussion on Art. We first
considered the subject of Art in Poetry. Poetry differs
from prose in two essential respects, namely, it
is farther off, and it expresses the emotions, and does
so in a musical form. Our standard for Art applies
in poetry, as well as in other things. In connection
with poetry we took up the subject of controversy
in art, and especially in poetry. We decided that a
controversial poem, or novel, is not good art because
it is one-sided and incomplete. If a man writes on
one side of a question he cannot be really in that
sympathetic frame of mind that is necessary for the
production of a good piece of art. We next took up
art in music, and decided that music is the most complete
or artistic of all arts, because it is farthest off,
and expresses most completely our ideal. We also
considered sculpture, and noted the fact that the
sculpture is the expression in human form of the
sculptor’s ideas. We also considered painting, and
after we had again applied our standard, Miss Sampter
told us that every picture has a central object or
figure, the figure of most importance; that all the
lines of the picture are direct toward it; and that in
every good painting there must be contrast, and all
the primary colors must be in it. It is complete in
every way. All the colors, light and shade, and the
idea of the painter well worked out, complete it.
We considered, besides, the subject of architecture,
and said that a building should in some measure express
the purpose for which it was to be used.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said she understood all this, and could gather
something of our last meeting. She did not quite
see what was meant by a thing in art being “far off.”
Henry told her it meant that though removed from
reason, and not clearly defined or lifelike, it appealed
to our sympathies and emotions, and we understood it
all the better. Then I read Henry’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In poetry and music, as in all the other arts, it
is completeness, complete harmony, which makes a
thing beautiful. Of all the arts the most beautiful
is music. Harmony is everything in music, and is
the principal in musical composition. A piece of
music always closes with the first note of the scale,
thus completing the chord. If it were otherwise we
would say there was something lacking. The phrase
itself shows us that what we want is completeness,
though few people stop to think of its full meaning
when they use it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have said that the farther away we are from
something, the more beautiful it seems. This is
true of music, which, besides being the most beautiful
of arts, is the farthest away, for we cannot say
anything definite with it, but must leave so much to
the sympathy of the listeners. I like to think of this
as a symbol of the beautiful completeness we hope
to realize some far-distant day, and that then there
will be something still more beautiful, that we shall
know in times still farther off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought this an excellent paper, and I told Henry
so. I said I was glad he had written more of musical
composition than I had been able to tell him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of some of our past meetings. Florence
said: “I couldn’t make Henry see the difference
between wit and humor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see it now,” he answered. “We discussed it in
school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So did we,” said Marian. “Isn’t it queer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had been taking up drama, too, and so their
club and school work harmonized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “You have heard people speak of the art
of life. To me it seems that to make an art of life,
to live it as if it were our creation, our work of art,
is the best way, the most complete and beautiful way.
You remember, I spoke to you of the three ways of
looking at life, of writing books, for instance: The
scientific way, the philosophic way, the artistic way.
One can live life in these three ways, too; but to me
the artistic way seems best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think,” asked Marian, “that if we lived
as an art, we should be too apt to excuse ourselves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean, Marian?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” she went on, “we should admit the
shadows in life as well as the light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The shadows,” I answered, “are not the wrong,
the bad. How can you think so? Are shadows in
a picture the mistakes in it? Shadows make the
rhythm and the contrast; and in life would be repose
and sleep. That necessary pulsation of activity
and rest alone can make life whole and perfect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Marian, “that is true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for blaming ourselves for things past, I think
it is silly to do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What,” they asked, “is the scientific way of
life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” I answered, “living according to small
definite truths, knowing certain separate things to
be good or bad for us, and living according to that
knowledge, without any general aim of life. It is
to bathe regularly, to tell the truth carefully, to be
honest, to look out for your neighbor, always because
each one of these things is expedient in itself.
The philosophic way is to see the final, complete
good, and to want that once, to lose yourself and
the beauty of your own life in the desperate effort
to make the whole world perfect now. Suppose, for
instance, that on Christmas a starving family came
to the door of a middle-class man for food. If
he were a scientist in his life he would send the poor
family at once to the public food kitchen, with a
ticket of recommendation, because he did not believe
in indiscriminate charity and pauperism. If he were
a philosopher he would be horrified at the idea of
any man lacking a dinner, and without further
thought would give his whole dinner to the poor,
and go without, and let his children go without. That
is just what Bronson Alcott did—the typical philosopher
in life—who neglected his own family for the
good of the universe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have often known of people,” said Henry, “who
went out to do charity and neglected their families.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “but that is sometimes for still
worse reasons. Now what would the artist in life
do? He would be full of the delight of Christmas
feeling; and he would either share his dinner with
the other man—according to circumstances—or ask
him in to his table, if the poor children were not
too dirty. He would look out for himself and for
the other man, and do it gracefully, beautifully. He
knows that first of all he must make his own life sane
and beautiful, but he wants to include as many other
lives as he can in that life of his, and to make all his
relations with men beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you call the philosophic way,” said Ruth,
“is what I had always called the artistic way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is,” I said, “because you have all of you
had a ridiculous, false idea of what the artist is.
The scientific life is the life according to particular
truths, without an aim. The philosophic life is the
life dreaming of supreme good, and neglecting the
particular, individual beauty of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But doesn’t the philosophic way help toward that
good?” asked Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “though often it tries only impracticable
schemes. The artistic way combines and
transcends the two. For the artist must have knowledge
of facts, must know science, and must love
supreme good, as well. Facts according to the supreme
good, life made beautiful to be like completeness,
that is the artistic life. It includes both the
scientific and the philosophic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is as it were the middle way?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “because beauty includes all extremes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry remarked: “It may be the best way, but
I wouldn’t guarantee to live according to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I smiled. “You mean,” I said, “that you didn’t
like the idea of asking the poor man in to dinner?”
He assented. “But you misunderstood me. That
was only a picture, a story, not a law. If we make
large laws for life—such laws as those of art—we
shall avoid petty moralizing, which I, for one, detest.
We shall see that every circumstance alters the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just this petty moralizing that is unnecessary,
when one has big laws and standards which he can
use in life, each for himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did come very near having a discussion on
truth-telling, but I stopped it at once. I was glad
to discover, however, that Ruth is not a stickler for
literal truth under all circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like little laws laid down,” I said, “because
they are never true and necessary in all cases.
They make me feel rebellious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marian, “they make one feel contrary,
and want to do just the opposite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke of the undeniable fact that all great action,
all history sprang from imaginative thought, that
a deed had to be imagined before it could be
done, that all history was inspired by the bards and
prophets. I spoke of even such scientific theories
as evolution springing from imaginative thought.
They all seemed to have realized this before, and
none dissented. I read to them O’Shawnessy’s Ode,
“We are the Music-makers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “We spoke of the thinker’s influence
lately, at home. But I always thought of
those great men, not as poets, but as philosophers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “they often were. But they
were poets, too. The greatest artist—as I showed
you—is a scientist and philosopher as well. Goethe
to me seems the best example of such a complete
man. His life was so many-sided, and yet so artistic,
so definite in its aim; it might stand as an example
of the artistic life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, what the children seemed to know of Goethe
was that he had a great many love affairs, and did
not behave well in any of them. Marian and Henry
had a clearer idea, and knew this was not the whole
or the chief part of his life, nor quite so faulty as
represented. Henry said: “He could appreciate the
good points in a woman without always falling in love
with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ruth said she didn’t know anything of
Goethe but his lover’s weakness, Marian turned on
her with: “Now, isn’t it a shame to know that of
him, and nothing else!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told them again that as every work of art was
a symbol of completeness, so every self, being a self,
symbolized the complete self of understanding and
unity; every man was a symbol of completeness, of
the Divine Self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before we went on to enumerate for ourselves the
laws of art, now that we all agreed they would be
one with the laws of life, I wished to read aloud some
slips from a Ruskin calendar, which Ruth had
brought me two weeks before. The most fruitful of
conversation were the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All are to be men of genius in their degree—rivulets
or rivers, it does not matter, so that the
souls be clear and pure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, they said, was exactly our idea of genius in
all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good work is never done for hatred, any more
than for hire—but for love only.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surely, then, not for controversy, we said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither a great fact, nor a great man, nor a great
poem, nor a great picture, nor any other great thing,
can be fathomed to the bottom in a moment of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every great man is always being helped by everybody,
for his gift is to get good out of all things and
all persons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, I reminded them, was what we had said
when we spoke of the good and bad, that we must
use all things for good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ennobling difference between one man and
another—between one animal and another—is precisely
in this, that one feels more than another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t it seem,” said Florence, “as if Ruskin
had written those papers especially for us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That last one,” I said, “expresses exactly our
idea; here ‘feeling’ means the same as ‘sympathy,’
or ‘feeling with.’ So you find, all through the old
books, the striving for this same truth, always vaguely
expressed, never fully understood, as an ideal, as a
religion of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth asked: “Don’t you think all great religions
have always believed in that final unity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite in this way,” I answered. “They have
vaguely striven for it and implied it, but never
realized it as the one meaning in life, the moving
force of the universe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gave each of them a pencil and a piece of paper,
and said we would find out and write down what were
the chief laws of all arts, and then follow that written
paper throughout our meetings. I said: “It
looks like a party, with the candy and the paper and
pencils.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Florence; “and now we are going to
play a guessing game!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first law upon which we decided, after some
conversation, was:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Art is the symbol of completeness, in a definite
shape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this last part, “in a definite shape,” I especially
insisted, showing them how the definite, the particular,
the finite—the drop as opposed to the mist—symbolized
completeness. I said for them Goethe’s
poem, “Ueber allen Gipfeln,” to show them how
so short, clearcut and simple a thing gave us the
sense of immensity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said he had thought at one time that if
one only knew the truth, it was not necessary to be
a good orator; one had simply to state the truth.
But now he believed the form an essential part of
the thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said something of the artistic life as meaning
one must have a single aim. I answered her it
might be so, but the single aim would be immense
and inclusive. Now we went on to the second law,
which we formulated thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Art is self-expression and self-fulfilment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Self-expression means action, creation. “Thinking,
writing, the work of the artist is action,” I said.
They understood. I quoted: “There is only one
gift worth giving, and that is one’s self.” “To give
one’s self,” I said, “that is action, that is life, creation
and fulfilment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How so fulfilment?” asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it is always fulfilment to do the thing
we love to do. Now what comes next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “To leave out the distracting; to
leave out detail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not necessarily detail,” I answered; “certain definite
details are essential.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said to leave out the irrelevant, the inharmonious,
the unnecessary. I said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. To leave out the unimportant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you see,” I asked, “how that will apply to
life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. Must have variety and many-sidedness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is, contrast, rhythm, the all-roundness which
makes the whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had just begun to speak of the next law when
I was called from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I returned, Henry said to me: “Well, then,
let us write down: ‘must not be for or against.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they had formulated it while I was away. I
answered: “Rather let us use the word ‘partisan,’
which means part, not whole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. Must not be partisan, and must be sympathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I said, art,</p>

<p class='pindent'>6. Must give the impression of truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not linger on this point, and was glad the
children accepted it without question, for I wanted
more time to explain it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on to the last law, which was the only one
I had some trouble in making clear. I asked why was
the photograph inartistic? They said because of inharmonious
details. I asked, why is the statue more
beautiful than wax works? Henry spoke again of
the “distance” of material, which just thereby appealed
to the sympathies. I wanted to speak of the
artist’s aloofness, how he was creator of his work,
within it, and yet around it and above it. They did
not understand. They said, if he were above it, he
would be unsympathetic. They did not understand
the creator’s attitude toward himself, the created;
the dramatic attitude in life, in which we are both
actor and spectator. Marian said she thought she
understood it. “Haven’t you ever laughed at yourself?”
she asked the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have sworn at myself,” said Leo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I meant to pass by the subject, and leave out the
last law, rather than arouse a self-consciousness, which
was the opposite of what I hoped to awaken. But
unintentionally the conversation led to a better understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke again of reverence, as I had done to Alfred,
of the small self awed in supreme moments,
before the immensity of its whole self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean,” asked Leo, “that it makes us feel
how small we are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I tried to make it clear. I spoke of the feeling
of nothingness that overcomes us, when we stand
under the stars at night, and realize them as worlds
and suns, and our planet as a dot of light in immensity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had all felt so, except Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said: “It does not make me feel small. I
feel that I am a part of it all, and one with the
universe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yours is the true feeling,” I answered, “for you
are, indeed, a part of it, and the realization of it is
within yourself. A kitten in your place would not
feel it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Marian, “that many people do not
feel it. For I have sometimes walked with some
one out in the night, or by the sea, and could not
speak. And suddenly they said some trivial thing,
which showed they did not feel as I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred said he felt overawed by the sea, because
it was so strong and big.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean,” I asked, “that it makes you feel
helpless before its might?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been said,” Henry went on, “that one cannot
be an astronomer and not worship, I believe it is
true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” I said, “we are coming to the seventh
law after all. For by aloofness I mean that the artist,
during his act of creation, feels his own immense
self, feels the whole universe, and sees himself and
all other things as a part in relation to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have felt that way sometimes,” said Florence,
“just for a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a momentary realization,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think,” asked Ruth, “that it is a superior
feeling, though; a cold, perfect feeling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered; “though it lifts us above petty
concern for ourselves, it does not lift us out of sympathy
and action.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “When I go to Riverside and see
all the lights, and think of the millions of people, I
feel them all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It reminded me of the day Marian had said she felt
so when she thought of all the windows and rooms
in all the apartment houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose,” I asked, “that you had failed in a
very important examination, Henry, would you feel
bad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “if it were a very, <span class='it'>very</span> important
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, if you went to Riverside Drive and forgot
yourself in that immense feeling, when you returned
home you would not only be over your sore, bitter
disappointment, but you would be full of energy to
begin work again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he answered, “I would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, you see, it is a creative, sympathetic, living
aloofness, not cold and far off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We put down for the seventh law:</p>

<p class='pindent'>7. Aloofness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowing what we meant thereby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said she had noticed that the artistic life
was a selfish ideal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “selfish in the best sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is self-development, you mean,” said Alfred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “and that selfishness includes
the whole world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why use the word ‘selfishness,’ then,” asked
Marian, “that has been used in another sense?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spent the rest of the time telling Leo our idea
of God and progress. Henry, Ruth, Florence and
Marian did it; Florence told him of complete human
sympathy, Marian of progress toward it as the good,
Henry explained the poem, “Abou ben Adhem,” and
Ruth—when Leo objected that knowing men was not
knowing God—quoted a passage from the Bible to
show it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always think of God as a supreme power,” said
Leo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him something of our idea. What I cared
for was to hear the others talk. All, except Henry,
seemed satisfied with a merely human conception of
self—that is, Florence set the key, and all but Henry
kept the tune. He spoke of the “something outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remarked that, as I had foreseen, we no longer
used the word God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I use it to myself,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “I use it when I speak to other people;
but not here, because we know what we mean,
without saying it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “We have made a vocabulary of
our own. Ought we to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said. “Perhaps we can impose it on
others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think that would be fair or right,” she
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? That is just what every great thinker
has done. He has imposed a new vocabulary upon
the world. Unless our words are good and great
and true, they will not last.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='eleven'></a>ELEVENTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I read Virginia’s paper of two weeks ago:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>DISCUSSION ON ART</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything to be really beautiful must be complete.
The reason for this is that it gives us that idea of
completeness which the universe possesses. A picture
in which every detail is painted may be pretty, but it
is not beautiful. When you look at a person you look
at his face and the expression of it. In anything on
which you set your eyes, you see only the part that
interests you. Therefore a good picture or a book
should only have that part brought forth, and the rest
and unimportant parts should be kept in the background.
In fact, they should only be there to make
the important thing more interesting; to make it
stand out.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then I read Henry’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At our last meeting we reviewed all that we had
said about art. We spoke of the three kinds of life,
the artistic, philosophic and scientific, and agreed
that the artistic life is the one we care for. We
made a list of those things which are necessary in
art, so that we can refer to them, and apply them in
judging life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good art</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. is a symbol of completeness in a definite form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. is self-expression and self-fulfilment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. must leave out unimportant detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. must have variety and many-sidedness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. must not be partisan, and must be sympathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6. gives the impression of truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>7. ——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last law, the idea of aloofness, of being above
as well as within life, of being actor and spectator
at once, they do not understand, and I made no further
effort to explain. Henry said he left it out—for
that reason—when writing his paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said Henry had mentioned we did prefer and
choose the artistic life. But why? I suspected, from
something they said, that they did not grasp the reasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said she didn’t care what the reasons
were, she knew she liked it best. The reasons, at
any rate, had not impressed them. So I repeated
what I had said, of the artistic life including the
other two, of how the artist must know science and
love goodness before he can create beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Florence, “the great artists were
philosophers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always,” I answered. “Take the ancient religious
writings, such as the Vedas and the Bible. They
were always poems, the work of artists who were
also philosophers and scientists.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scientists?” asked Marian incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” I answered, “men such as Moses, who
gave laws on sanitation and daily life, were the
scientists of their time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An artist must understand science,” said Virginia,
“natural science, if he wants to paint. And he
must know physiology, too. I am beginning to realize
that at school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one mentioned Franklin. “Was he more
scientist, or philosopher, or artist in his life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he was a philosopher,” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Marian answered, “he just gathered a lot
of bromidic proverbs, that were as old as the world,
and said them over in an impressive way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they were philosophical,” Virginia protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Marian, “I don’t think so. They were
scientific, for they dealt with little disjointed parts
of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told them I wanted to paraphrase a certain verse
in the Bible, the verse:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faith, Hope and Charity, but the greatest of these
is Charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” asked Ruth, much interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would say,” I went on, “‘Truth, Goodness and
Beauty, but the greatest of these is Beauty’—because
it includes the other two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I changed the first law into terms of life:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life is a symbol of the complete Self, in a definite
shape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life must express that Self in definite and individual
lines, that is, in beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke again of small and great genius, of art
expressing a lesser or a greater completeness, of
“Jenny Kissed Me” and “Faust,” Florence’s examples.
“With people you must have noticed the same
thing. Some people whose lives seem very limited,
who understand and know little, still have such harmonious
natures that in their spheres they seem complete.
But with still other people you feel that their
lives are much larger, that they grasp more of life
and possess more, because they understand more.
The more we understand, sympathize and love, the
larger is our life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Marian?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” she said, “should some people be larger
and more complete than others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean, Marian?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is it so? Why aren’t we all alike?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we were,” said Henry, “it would be very monotonous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know that,” said Marian. “But why is
it so, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marian always asks the unanswerable,” I said.
“And still—if we believe in progress, in the evolution
of self, don’t you see?—some selves are more developed
than others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we believed in transmigration,” said Marian,
“it would be easy to understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” I answered, “what I think of transmigration.
But whether there be transmigration in
the usual sense, or not, I think we all believe that
in some way we have lived until now, that we are
not created in one moment, that we evolve throughout
all time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now I made a mistake, tried an experiment
that was not successful. I have had misgivings, now
and then—unfounded ones, I believe to-day—as to
the value, to young people, of a philosophy of life
which does not at once directly and concretely affect
their manner of living, but does so indirectly and
slowly through affecting their tastes, opinions and
desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the girls happened to speak of the relation
of parents and children. I had realized for a long
time that this was among the pressing problems of
youth—especially of some of these particular young
people—and instead of keeping to my prepared work,
I took advantage of the remark, and launched off
into that bottomless subject—without a pilot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I think it is one of the gravest—perhaps
the only grave problem—of your lives, and we might
as well try to solve it now, if we can. What shall
we do with our parents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a flood of ideas and confessions. I
made so personal a call upon each one, and intimated
that I already knew so much of their lives, that
they were frank and open with me, and said to me,
without thinking, much more, I am sure, than they
would willingly and deliberately have said to each
other. They spoke as if to me alone, even mentioned
personal circumstances of which I alone had knowledge.
Naturally, I will not write down that conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told them the difficulty arose from a change for
the better in the relation between children and
parents, and that neither one nor the other had fully
realized the change. The old relation of fearing
reverence had been changed to that of love and companionship.
I said, mock-seriously:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, we do know more than our parents can
possibly know, and we are quite able to judge everything
for ourselves, and so we resent being told to
do things——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian interrupted me with a solemn: “Oh, no!”
and it was a moment before they all realized that I
was joking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, truly,” I went on, “we are so used to having,
and fond of having, our own way, that we do chafe
and even feel contradictory the moment we are ordered
to do anything. Don’t you, Alfred?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Alfred; “only I don’t like to stop if
I have anything else to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate,” Marian said, “to be told to do anything
which I don’t want to do, and for which I see no
reason: going to see people whom I dislike, and who
bore me, for instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” I answered, “the reason is clear. I remember
feeling so myself, and I am not glad that I
was given my own way. Young people must know
and see and tolerate all sorts of folks, even pokey old
relations, so that they may learn to know people and
be able to choose for themselves as they grow older.
To know many is to find some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that they agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I went on, “the trouble is not so much
with what you want or don’t want to do, as with
irritability and impudence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean ‘sassing’ your parents?” asked Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ‘sass’ mine,” she said, “when I think they will
like it. I wheedle my parents, and so I get what I
want without being disagreeable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, <span class='it'>you</span> don’t count, Virginia,” I went on, “but
what I mean is answering back, being unkind and
contradictory when we would rather not, doing all
sorts of regrettable things because we are in a temper,
and then afterward feeling mean, sore and despicable,
and knowing that we were wrong. That sort
of ugliness and irritation, if it’s not stopped, makes
mean, ugly, irritable characters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know just what you mean,” said Marian, “and
I know exactly what I think of other people who are
like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is ugly,” I said. “I dislike it, because it is
not beautiful. How can any one live a beautiful,
harmonious life who begins by being out of harmony
in his relation with the person whom he loves? For
that is the truth. Children often love dearly the
parent with whom they are always disagreeing. How
shall we get understanding and unity and sympathy
in life if we cannot get it with those nearest us, those
we love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Henry, “our idea of life, of complete
sympathy, is against all that kind of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is much easier,” said Marian, “to know what
is right than to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why,” I said, “should we suffer regrets, and
do ugly things, when there must be some way to
stop it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What way?” asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, first, what is our feeling toward older people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pity,” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” we all asked rather indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she went on, “you get up for an old
woman in the car, because you are sorry for her,
so that she shouldn’t flop all over your shins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pity for the other people!” said Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(We are always undecided in the club whether to
put Virginia out of the room or whether to hug her.
So, in our indecision, we leave her alone.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “We used to be told to reverence the old.
I say to you, reverence every one. If you think of
self as a symbol of the complete Self, as the holy
thing, then you will reverence the self in every human
being, in every creature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think,” said Virginia, “that we have much
sympathy with the self in animals we kill to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” I answered, “is another question. It has
nothing to do with what we are saying now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it has,” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” I said, “if you reverence self, and understand
and respect the self in every person, how could
you quarrel with any one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You expect us to know an awful lot,” said Virginia,
“to know every one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” I answered. “Is not that our idea,
to reach what we desire through understanding and
sympathy with every one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said they couldn’t respect every one. Some
people they couldn’t help, as Henry said, pitying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I objected strenuously to that word. All but Henry
agreed with me. It is always a word of scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They spoke of “feeling sorry for” people who had
suffered some loss, feeling sorry, but not pitying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Marian, “one ought not to say ‘sorry
for’ but ‘sorry with.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said if a girl’s mother had died, and one
had not known the mother, one might be sorry for
her, but not sorry with her. They had a little argument,
and to stop it I said one might be both sorry
for and sorry with, but certainly one would have the
“with” feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth objected that when there was an argument
I always made both sides right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” I asked. “By the light of complete
vision we do see most things as true which first seemed
contradictory. Our idea of completeness is to include
many truths, and show them to be the same
truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She admitted that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian spoke of people she liked, but could not
respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you knew them from the inside,” I said, “as
they know themselves, you might feel otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Virginia, “I have always thought that
if anybody knew all about me, knew me just as I
know myself, they could not help liking me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “It seems not much to expect of us, to
understand our parents, who are so anxious for an
understanding, and whom we love. After all, we
do owe them something—when you consider that but
for them we would not be here; and we are most of
us rather glad that we are here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marian, “I would like to stay a while
longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we spoke of many things, many personal
things, of quarrels and how to avoid them. Virginia
amused us by saying people often quarreled with her,
but she never quarreled with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “If there’s one thing which makes
people feel mean, angry, self-reproachful and small,
it is to try to quarrel with some one who won’t be
made angry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally,” I said, “they can’t help comparing
themselves with the other person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Florence, “I am always sorry and
angry at myself when the other person keeps cool or
is hurt. But when the other person gets angry, too,
I feel as if I were right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an ugly thing to be angry,” I said; “it makes
us so small, shuts us in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?” asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cuts us off from that other person, makes it
impossible to understand at least him, and so keeps
us from completeness and harmony, actually robs us
of part of ourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it all the children’s fault, they asked, when
children and parents failed to understand each other?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it takes two to make a quarrel,” I answered,
“so it takes two to make a misunderstanding. But
<span class='it'>one</span> can stop it. Remember that older people have
often gone through trials in life that have shaken
their nerves and made them sensitive and irritable to
little annoyances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian asked: “Do you mean fussy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “and it is easy to understand. But
the fact that in many families some of the children
get along well with the parents, and others do not,
proves that at least some of the responsibility rests
with the children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of self-control, of standing, as it were,
outside and above ourselves—the idea of aloofness—and
not working like a machine for the impulse of
the moment. I said I had known people who had
this trouble in youth, and stopped it with a strong
resolution, because they saw it was a bad, an ugly and
a controllable thing. Henry spoke of the old plan
of counting a hundred before saying anything. We
none of us liked the idea, possibly because we were
tired of it; I said, for one, that I did not see how
counting a hundred could make me change my mind,
whereas thinking might. I said the best plan was to
put one’s self at once, as it were, inside the other person,
and then one could not possibly say the disagreeable
thing. Henry, it seems, has only one difficulty,
that of wanting to express or keep his own opinion at
the expense of contradicting his elders. I said one
had always the right to express one’s opinion, but
one might also do it as an opinion, say “I think,” or “I
believe”; that one might always consider how the
thing said would impress the person listening. Marian
spoke of people who irritate you by their presence,
whom you dislike and who grate on you, no matter
what they may do or say. Then I told them of the
saving sense of humor; how, if we resolve to be
amused by people in a pleasant, genial way, to see
the humor in human life, we may avoid being hurt
by them or hurting them in return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia especially agreed with me, cited incidents
of being amused by the disagreeable, and spoke of
Dickens as one who could be amused by all sorts
of people, even the most “bromidic” or disagreeable.
Marian said Dickens was amused by every one but
his heroes and heroines. They almost always seemed
a hardship to him and to others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said we must use every one for our good. That
word to “use people” had been employed in a bad
sense, but I meant it in a good sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whenever you are with any one you don’t like,
think at once what you can get out of that meeting.
Every human being has something for you, and you
for him. Self always wants to find self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian and Ruth immediately thought of people
from whom they could get nothing. Virginia, who
does get something from everything, remarked that
some people seemed to have very little self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be a human being at all,” I answered, “how
much of self one must have, compared with the animals!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” said she; “that is why some people,
who have not much, remind me of animals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I was sorry we had digressed so far, and
feared we had not arrived anywhere, after all. Florence
said she liked to confess her sins. And Marian
answered her that it was a bad habit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all,” said Marian, “what I have heard before,
and know to be true, and don’t do, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing new?” I asked. “Not even the plan of
trying to feel at once just what the other person is
feeling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, that, perhaps,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian seemed to think I had given her a great
many dreadful “slams”; but I could not see it so.
“I am sure I did not,” I said. “Oh, no,” she answered
quite sarcastically, “not at all.” But she
seemed to bear me no ill-will. Virginia said I wanted
them to be good and virtuous. No, I said, I had not
thought of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” she suggested, “good but not virtuous,
or virtuous but not good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered: “All I want you to do is to satisfy
yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all!” exclaimed Marian. “After you told
us how we could never be wholly satisfied, how we
should always want something more!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The beautiful life must be harmonious,” I said.
“Disjointed beauty is not beautiful. You remember,
we spoke of the city, how a beautiful house might
be made to look not at all beautiful by being placed
next to a high wall, or in any position where it did
not fit; how the city could not be beautiful until all
the people combined to build a harmonious city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By itself the house would be beautiful, anyway,”
they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “but in ugly surroundings its
beauty would be half lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “If I saw a very beautiful little girl
between two ugly monkeys, I think the little girl
would look all the more beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian answered: “I would immediately imagine
her petting or fondling the two monkeys, and then
it would look beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It turned out, however, that Virginia’s monkeys
were figurative, and that she meant ugly children.
This was disconcerting to Ruth, Marian and Florence,
and caused prolonged giggles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that would simply be contrast, not discord,
that contrast might please and make even the ugly
look beautiful, but discord, two beautiful houses so
placed together that neither looked well, two colors
that “killed” each other, these were ugly. Beauty
had to find for itself or make for itself the right surroundings,
in order to be truly beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “I think it is a shame people should
be liked just for their looks. I know girls who are
liked just because they are pretty, when there’s nothing
to them, and others who are homely, but much
nicer, who are liked less. I try never to let it influence
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said he never did let it; that he always liked
people for what they really were, and not for looks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help it,” said Virginia. “I know a girl
who is horrid in every way, and when she is away
I can’t bear her; but the minute I see her I forgive
her, because she is so beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” I said, “if you knew her from the inside,
as she knows herself, you might think that no
one could help liking her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Virginia; “she’s one of the people who,
I feel sure, cannot think that of herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian agreed with Virginia. She said when she
met people she was interested in the good-looking
ones, and always judged them by their faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is different,” I said, “to judge people by the
character written in their faces, as we judge them
by all things. But though all beauty is good, the
beauty of the personality, of life itself, is surely best.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='twelve'></a>TWELFTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Through inevitable circumstances the club had
been discontinued for six weeks. But I was in personal
touch with all the members during this interval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have not met for so long,” I said, “I wonder
whether you have forgotten anything of what we
had done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all assured me that it was clear in their
minds. Henry said: “It has had time to sink in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad,” I went on, “that we happened to stop
at the end of a part; that now we begin anew at a
new thing. But I am a little afraid to go on. For
now we are going to speak of morals, of goodness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you afraid?” asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I am so afraid we are going to moralize,
to become petty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be afraid of that,” said Marian; “I have
had too much experience to be likely to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then,” I said, “first of all we must find out
what we consider good, what we mean by the good—that
misused word—and to distinguish between the
true and the artificial good. Have you any ideas
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of them had any definite idea of what they
meant by the good, or of the distinction between the
goody-goodiness which repelled them, and the goodness
which they loved. They thought immediately of
“good” people who are unlovable or stupid. Virginia
and Marian exchanged remarks about a girl
they had met that morning at Sunday-school; and all
through the meeting, until I found effective means
to stop them, they referred to her as an example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I said, “I will tell you of the true good,
and by the light of it you will clearly distinguish the
artificial. You remember the first law of art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry had the paper with him. It was: “Art is
a symbol of completeness in a definite shape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the good, too, is a symbol of completeness in
a definite shape,” I said. “Goodness is always of relation.
It means the right relation, sympathy and
unity of those who know each other. And the good
man is the man who makes a complete world, a symbol
of the perfect awakened universe, out of those
few people whom he knows—that is, of whose existence
he is aware—and of all that he knows in the
universe, which is a small part of the whole. He
makes it complete and perfect, by making all his relations
with life complete, and understanding and
beautiful. You realize that a Robinson Crusoe, alone
on his desert island, if he never expected to see human
beings again, could not be either good or bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he could,” said Virginia, “in the way he
treated the animals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is right,” I answered. “If you include the
animals as selves, he could still be good or bad in
his relation with them. But you see that goodness is
of relation. It is having our relations right, good and
sympathetic, as far as they reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, then, is the law, the only law. All moralities
and systems were made to uphold and fulfil that
law, and they all change with the needs of man and
his circumstances, but that one law is always the
same, is always true, is the spirit which makes all
actions either good or bad. For I believe there is no
action in itself either good or bad, but all must be
tested by this law. ‘Is it good?’ means: Does it
make for true and understanding relations between
men? Do you agree with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take the laws of Moses, or any system of laws,”
I went on, “and you will see that they were made by
men, who realized in themselves the one supreme law,
the law of progress toward the human whole. These
systems of laws, if followed by people incapable of
seeing the broad way for themselves, would lead toward
that end. But the lesser laws change with circumstance,
as a path changes with the landscape.
Take the Mosaic laws. The first laws, ‘Thou shalt
have no other God,’ ‘Thou shalt not take his name
in vain,’ and ‘Thou shalt keep the Sabbath,’ seem to
us now much less important than some later laws,
such as ‘Thou shalt not steal,’ ‘Thou shalt not kill,’
and so on. But if you stop to think, you will see
that these first were most necessary; for the people’s
idea of God, so much more limited than ours, was
still, like ours, the reason for their morality, the
law of laws, the ‘I Am’ that gave meaning to goodness.
In their condition, if they had not reverenced
and feared God, they would not have kept the laws
of Moses. The actions or ways of life we often hear
called good, but which arouse in us a feeling of contempt,
as if it were goody-goodiness, or self-righteousness,
are actions according to petty laws of goodness,
by people who do not know the spirit, the great law
above all laws. Sometimes they are actions no longer
good at all, acted according to petty laws that we
have passed. Do you see what I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me an example of what you mean,” Marian
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many conventions are an example,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they may be,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Conventions,” said Virginia, “are neither right
nor wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “they are usually a matter of
convenience. But some people do make the mistake
of calling them right or wrong. Then again you will
hear people argue whether or not it is right to tell
the truth, under all circumstances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean,” Henry said, “that they argue
whether or not it is good to tell the truth as truth,
not whether the truth will help us toward better
relation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Virginia, “to tell the truth to hurt
people’s feelings is wicked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now they were just going to have an argument as
to truth-telling, when I reminded them that this was
what we did not want to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian spoke of school laws, and said that these
were often without force or reason, and that she
saw no great harm in breaking them. When I remembered
the folly of laws in many schools, I could
not disagree with her. “Of course,” she said, “one
gets out of sympathy with that class of mortals called
teachers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly,” said I, “if one is honest at all times.
And perhaps the meanest, most cowardly lie is the lie
of evasion and shirking of punishment in such a case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “Teachers ought not to ask boys and
girls, ‘did you do this or that?’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” I answered; “but, again, no boy
or girl of spirit, courage and character would hesitate
to answer truthfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Self-sacrifice,” I said, “is a good example of the
sort of action that is called good in itself, when it is
not at all so, but has only a definite and limited purpose
in the scheme. I wish to explain it to you. But
first I want to be sure that you understand this idea
of good. Is it new to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marian, “I never thought of it in
that way before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You all have said so little,” I went on, “I am
afraid you may not fully understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing to say,” answered Marian, “for
it grows so naturally out of everything we have done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our whole thought is like a chain,” said Virginia,
“link within link.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alfred,” I said, “you are so silent, you don’t
give us a chance to see how bright you are. Now, tell
me, what is the good? What do I mean? I want
to be sure you understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated. “The good is completeness, harmony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “but I want it more definitely. The
good is a sign of that completeness. To the truly
good man, as much as he knows of the world, or
dreams of it, is his whole self. And he wants that
whole self to be right. The good man cannot be
wholly good until every one else is so. The world
must be perfect to satisfy his desire for good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said: “It is what you told us before, that we
cannot be perfect unless the universe is perfect. But
it seems to me that a man may be just as good,
though others are bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “he can do his best to fill out the
gaps and make his relations right, but his goodness
will not wholly satisfy him. On the other hand, the
self-righteous man, who lives according to precepts
and rules, is easily satisfied with himself. Goodness
is beauty. The good is always the beautiful action.
But goodness, according to laws and precepts which
are outworn, which we have left behind us, is no
longer beautiful for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia pointed out that in this, then, goodness
differed from art, for the objects of art remained
beautiful through hundreds of years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six hundred years ago,” she said, “men painted
pictures which probably cannot be equalled to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I answered, “a man trying to paint like
Raphael now, would not paint beautifully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said she; “but if he tried to paint like Franz
Hals or Rembrandt he might.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” she admitted, “he would have to
paint like himself, to be himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” said I, “and so with goodness. Each
man has his own particular goodness, according to
his circumstances and nature. But, just as a beautiful
picture is eternally beautiful, so goodness in the
past, though it no longer seems good to us for practice,
is always delightful to think of, though it would
be horrible to imitate. For instance, the self-imposed
poverty of St. Francis of Assisi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of asceticism and the ideals of self-sacrifice,
and then of self-sacrifice itself, as preached
in our own lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the first place,” I said, “we must get clear
in our minds the meaning of happiness. People will
say to you again and again that the aim of life is happiness.
But if each one of us were to speak of happiness,
and use the same word, we would each mean
something different. Now, what is happiness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is having fun,” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “that is all right. But that’s only
repeating the same thing. What is it that makes us
happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence answered: “Having what you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “but more than that. It is having
what you want most. If you liked pie, but you liked
ice cream better, then pie wouldn’t satisfy you, would
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ice cream and pie both,” said Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We decided, however, after some thought, that we
would give up pie for ice cream. “And this,” I said,
“is the meaning of self-sacrifice. It is giving up what
we want for something we want still more. And as
the thing we want most of all, and for which we
would give up everything else, is complete harmony,
sympathy and understanding, you see that in all our
self-sacrifices we are giving up what we want for what
we want still more. We are giving up our smaller
for our larger self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is just what Booker T. Washington said at
the lecture this morning,” Virginia went on. “He
said he had never made a single sacrifice, but he had
always done the thing he loved to do most. It is
fun to do good. It makes us feel so virtuous. And
we do it because we like most to see other people
happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I mean, Virginia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think it is so, always,” said Ruth. “I
think often people are just forced to give up things
and sacrifice themselves, when they don’t like it at
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s different,” I said, “if it is enforced. I
meant voluntary self-sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so,” she went on, “suppose you are going
out somewhere, and you have to stay at home with
some person who is ill, just because you are asked
to do it. You don’t like it, but you do it, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably,” I answered, “you love that person and
that person’s pleasure far more than you do, say, the
theatre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Ruth, “perhaps you don’t love the person
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you love to feel virtuous,” Virginia said, “and
all the time you stay at home you are saying bad
things, mentally, about that person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you stay from choice, you please your bigger
self and its demands for beauty,” I went on; “you
give up what you want for what you want more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Virginia said, “for you would be uncomfortable
and unhappy if you went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see how silly and childish it is,” I continued,
“to give up anything for nothing, to deny yourself
pleasures, to make sacrifices for their own sake. That
is one of the false virtues which make people self-righteous,
‘goody-goody’ and ridiculous. I know a
girl who gave up eating butter during Lent because
she liked butter, and she thought it noble to deny
herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Virginia, “and I know girls who won’t
take sundaes during Lent, but drink sodas instead,
because they like sundaes better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I read aloud to them a Ruskin quotation that
Ruth had brought some time ago:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Recollect that ‘mors’ means death, and delaying;
and ‘vita’ means life, and growing; and try always,
not to mortify yourself, but to vivify yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” I said, “I believe in being selfish, in the
very largest sense. I believe the whole world, all
that I know and love, to be my whole self, and I
want to make that as good, as true, as harmonious
as I can. What people usually call selfishness is only
self-limitation, cutting yourself off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; it is making yourself little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. Take selfish people, and you will find
that they are not only making others unhappy, but
making their own lives very small and narrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are unhappy themselves,” said Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told them a story of three apple seedlings. The
first said: “I will not grow; there is so little room;
I will not help crowd out the others.” He died, a
weakling. The second said: “I will not bear apples,
because the effort might spoil the glossy appearance
and fulness of my foliage.” He was good to
look at, but—useless. The third one said: “Apple-trees
were made to bear apples. I like to do it, I
want to do it, and I will.” And he did, and so served
himself and many beside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never could understand the morality,” I said,
“that tells us to live only for others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be impossible,” said Henry; “one has
to live first for one’s self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And last for one’s self,” I went on, “for that
biggest self which is our own life in relation with all
that we know. If we lived only for others, others
would still live for others, and so on, with no end
and no sense. It is like that idea of living for future
generations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of it?” asked Marian. “I am particularly
interested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That we shall live for future generations, and the
future generations shall live also for future generations,
and so on forever and ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless it were all for the last generation,” said
Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that will never come,” I answered, “or, if it
does, it will surely not be worth while. I believe that
whoever lives the best life for himself, and does the
thing he is most impelled to do, for his whole big
self, is also best for all others. He must be, since
they are a part of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me,” said Marian, who had been
dreaming, “that there is no absolute truth. When
people claim that they have found the whole truth,
and try to explain it to me, I never feel convinced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does our idea strike you so, Marian?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” she said, “not at all. You never make
positive statements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “I am willing to grant that what
seems true to me now may one day be included in a
larger truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke a few words, here, of envy. They
agreed at once that artistic envy, the envying of capabilities
and talents, was impossible to one who felt
that others were doing things for him, that what he
lacked in himself he would find in others, for his
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Florence, “there are so many other
kinds of envy, where other people having the thing
does you no good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” I said; “a beggar, for instance,
envying the rich people in a restaurant for their food,
will not lose his hunger through seeing them eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told them of the danger and difficulty of our
philosophy of right and wrong, how I hesitated to
tell it to them for fear they might misuse it, and
how much harder it was to guide one’s self by so
big a standard than by an unbeautiful, ready-made
morality of little laws and precepts. He must take
the straight and narrow path, who cannot guide himself
across the prairies by the path of stars and
planets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia insisted on my repeating some facts I
had told her lately. A young French girl of good
education, made desperate by poverty and lack of
work, slashed a picture in the Louvre, in order to be
arrested, get shelter and food, and attract attention
to the injustice of her lot. We discussed such cases,
and decided that where society did so great a wrong,
the lesser wrong might be part of the cure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot judge people,” I said, “when circumstances
drive them to do wrong in self-defence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We came near forgiving every one, when I reminded
them of the sternness of our standard. It
made us lenient with others, who did not—and perhaps
could not—know that they might master circumstance,
and that the whole world was their whole
self. But with ourselves it made us terribly exacting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people are like animals,” said Virginia. “I
can’t understand them, and cannot sympathize with
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” I said, “is your loss, you superior animal.
Ruskin says somewhere, and quite truly, that who
cannot sympathize with the lower cannot sympathize
with the higher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Virginia plunged off into a stream of delightful
nonsense, told us how she sometimes loved and
sometimes hated herself, how, if she was very happy,
she had to pay the penalty of reaction, and how interesting
she was, altogether. As a punishment we
made her keep still for five minutes by the watch.
I hoped Alfred would talk instead. Suppose we
punished him by making him talk for five minutes!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “What I like most of all is to
be liked. I often envy people their lovableness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally,” said I, “that is what we all like most,
isn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the truly good person, in our sense of good,
is also the lovable, beloved person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian and Virginia exchanged glances. They
were thinking again of that girl in Sunday-school,
who, they said, was thoroughly good, but not at all
lovable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good person,” I said, “is also the intelligent,
sympathetic person. Sympathy, understanding love,
is the great virtue. I have made a list of seven virtues.
Would you like to hear them? First, Love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, they said, included all the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, I answered, it was the chief. Second, Courage.
Courage, they said, to do as we believed. Third,
Trustworthiness. They all agreed. Fourth, love of
knowledge. Fifth, love of beauty. Sixth, insight.
Seventh, a sense of humor!</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this time Virginia and Marian were fitting
each virtue to that girl, and found her lacking only
in the latter ones, but no more lovable or interesting
than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure they are not speaking of you or
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” she answered; “perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know the girl, Ruth?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “please bring her to the next meeting.
She interests me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth promised, despite the protestations and explanations
of Marian and Virginia. “You would
know, then, of whom we had been talking,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” I answered, “she shall stay away on
one condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you don’t mention her again. I always
feel,” I went on, “that when any one is badly spoken
of, I am being criticized behind my back. Just as
when a race, such as the negroes, for instance, is
unjustly spoken of, I feel like fighting for my rights;
for I take it as a mere matter of chance that I didn’t
happen to be one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Florence,” I continued, “is quite right in wanting
to be loved. It is the best thing in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Except loving,” said Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” I answered; “but to want to be loved
by those we love for what we really are, and truly
to wish to be what they can truly love, that is the
whole of goodness, I believe. The only difference
between vanity and true worth is that the vain person
wishes to appear to be what is lovable—which is
very unsafe—and the truly good person wishes to
be it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean,” said Henry, “that vanity is company
manners?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Florence said. “I have liked
people who used ‘company manners’ for some company,
and not for others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have known people,” said Marian, “who were
always agreeable and sweet, and appeared to want
every one to like them, and yet were not a bit lovable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally,” I said, “the person who wishes to
be loved for what he is, is also willing to be hated
for it, if he must, by those who think otherwise.” I
said there was a man of whom we had heard much
during the last days (because of his centenary) who
seemed to be exactly what we meant by good. This
was Abraham Lincoln. We spent some time speaking
of him, the man who, it seems to me, might have
inspired a new American religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We always sympathize most with those,” said
Henry, “who sympathize with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We love them most,” I said, “but the man of
large heart will often sympathize with people who
understand him no better than they understand the
sunshine: with the bad man, for instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the drama of life,” I said, “he who loves
beauty and his whole self will live so as to make
that whole beautiful, and for this joy and beauty will
gladly give up his petty satisfactions. For remember
that the good life is the beautiful life, and the influential
life. Indeed, every life in this drama has
immense influence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For good or bad,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, surely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought not,” answered Florence; “each one
has a very, very small influence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the universe, perhaps, but we know nothing,
and can know nothing, of that. We cannot make
comparisons with infinity. But with those we love,
who know us, in our own family, our own circle of
friends, the influence of each one is immense. Think
of any family you know, of your own family, and
see how much difference each one makes in the whole,
how each one changes the whole. Each one influences
all the others, and makes the tone and color
of life, whether he will or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” said Henry, “that even those who
have no influence, who do nothing, could have an
influence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can’t help having it, for good or bad. And
people can know they have this influence, and use it
consciously, to make life about them as they wish it
to be. As a woman who comes into a house, if she
loves beauty and order, will set it in order at once
and make it beautiful, so that it will be all changed
because of her, and for her pleasure, so in life we
can set all things in order and change them to our
wish, by our presence and character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think,” Ruth said, “that the good is always
beautiful. Often the thing we have to do is
disagreeable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For instance, what?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In school work, for example. We have to study
subjects that are hard and disagreeable, simply to
pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that you have to do disagreeable things
to get what you want. Naturally. That is self-sacrifice.
And you cannot always do things as you
would like to do them. The woman in the house
might find ugly wallpaper, and not be able to change
that. But she would find other means of making
things look better. People can have conscious influence;
and the difference between those who make
life good and beautiful, and those who attract attention
to themselves, is the difference between the play
in which all the actors are good, and combine to
make a beautiful play, and the one where there is
a star who wants a poor cast to set off her charms,
and produces an inartistic and uneven play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how one could have conscious influence,”
said Marian; “it seems to me one lives unconsciously
all the time. I like to dream. I am not
fond of acting. I don’t believe I would ever have
any conscious influence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To dream and dream and keep on dreaming, and
not act, is impossible,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” asked Florence, “isn’t it just the dreamers
who do all the great things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” I answered, “one cannot help influencing
people, even by one’s dreams. But you, Florence,
you must realize how much difference each member
of a family makes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Virginia, I believe, has often made conscious
effort toward cheerful influence, and knows what I
mean. You, too, Ruth; I am certain you know exactly
what I mean, and I hope you and Marian will
talk it over; for it is an interesting subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know well what you mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we left I asked Alfred to write a paper for me.
“For,” I said, “they will begin to think you stupid
if you show no sign of intelligence. And even I
would like a tangible proof of what I really know,
that you do grasp exactly the spirit of what we say.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='thirteen'></a>THIRTEENTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Marian was absent. I read aloud Henry’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last Sunday we met for the first time in almost
two months. We had finished talking about art, and
we started on a new course in which we shall apply
our standard of beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our topic last Sunday was Goodness. Good is a
much-abused word. We often speak disdainfully of
a person, as being a goody-goody, but usually this
person, though not necessarily bad, is not good according
to the standard of to-day. In the last generation,
and even in some places to-day, the good child
is the one which does its work conscientiously, and
spends all its spare time at sewing or doing odd jobs
around the house. The ‘good man’ does his work
faithfully, never swears or lies under any circumstances,
and follows his religion, as it is set down
for him by others, absolutely to the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In speaking of bad, one kind we mentioned was
that which was once good, but which we have left
behind us in our progress. This is true of that old
standard. We have said that what we want is complete
sympathy. That which is beautiful is the symbol
of completeness, and the good is beautiful; and
therefore the man with a warm, sympathetic heart
is the good man. A splendid type of this sort of
man is Abraham Lincoln, a man who suffered with
the sufferer, and rejoiced with the happy; a man
with charity for all and enmity toward none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We condemn the selfish man, but the man who
does so much for others that he does nothing for
himself, is to be criticized just as much. Hillel says:
‘If I am not for myself, who will be for me?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is really no such thing as self-sacrifice, for
if you voluntarily give up one thing for another, it
is because you like it better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that this paper proved to me, what I had
already suspected, that in the last meeting I had
dwelt too much on one side of our subject, and not
enough on the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” said Henry, “I spent too much time
describing the man who isn’t truly good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “I don’t mind that. But you
say ‘the man with a warm and sympathetic heart is
the good man.’ To be the truly good and great man,
one must have more than a warm and sympathetic
heart, more, even, than a feeling of kindliness and
sympathy for one’s fellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak of Lincoln as a man ‘with charity for
all and enmity toward none.’ But Lincoln was much
more than that. This alone would not have made
him great and splendid. What did?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “He was a man of determination,”
and, before I could answer, Alfred went on: “He
was a man of large sympathies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “it is the combination of the two;
it is more than both. I mean that the great and good
man is the man whose final far-off aim is the unity
and completeness of man, who shapes his life and his
work toward that aim, who works for it, lives for it,
sacrifices himself and all things to it; and such a
man was Lincoln. He made mistakes—he used them
for his cause. His morality, his law, was the union—that
symbol of the larger union—and for this immense
self-fulfilment he worked with his might, and died for
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Henry, “and the great man must make
mistakes, and go beyond them. Roosevelt, for instance,
is always making mistakes, and then acknowledging
them, and going forward once more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely. And so Lincoln worked for the union,
in sympathy with all men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In one speech,” said Henry, “he asked Davis, his
opponent in the House, to ‘help him save the union.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Henry,” I said, “there is another thing
in your paper—if you don’t mind my saying it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean that when you quoted Hillel you should
have finished the quotation: ‘If I am not for myself,
who will be for me?’ and ‘but if I am for myself
alone, what am I then?’ You did not bring out the
idea of the large and small self, of sacrificing the
small self to the large, because you love the large
self above all else, not because you like it better.
This morning I heard a lecture by Professor Royce,
of Harvard, and it is curious that he used exactly the
same words we used in speaking of self-sacrifice. He
said we sacrifice the small to the large self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point Ruth came in, and brought Marian’s
paper. I read it at once:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our meeting of the Seekers of February 14th
was very interesting. We talked about goodness.
First we tried to define <span class='it'>good</span>, and finally reached the
conclusion that <span class='it'>goodness</span> means being in a harmonious
relation with all our fellow-beings. We should
try to make our life like some beautiful picture or
other work of art, making it a complete and harmonious
whole. All our friends and acquaintances,
everything we see, hear, do or know, help to make
this picture; and if we try, we can consciously make
it what we want. We are masters of our lives, and if
we remember this, it will influence all our thoughts
and deeds. We also spoke of happiness, and decided
that each one has a different kind of happiness, depending
on what he wants most. We also spoke of
self-sacrifice. There is really no such thing as self-sacrifice,
because when we give up one thing it is
always because we think another finer, and because
we want the other more. We cannot have every
detail in our picture as clear as the main idea, and
we must give up something to bring out this idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all thought this paper excellent. I told Ruth
briefly what we had said before she came; and then
we spoke at length of the importance of living our
belief, of working for the cause, of giving ourselves
to the large self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Every great man has always done just
that, whether he was writer, philosopher, artist,
statesman or scientist; he has always devoted himself
to a work which aimed toward the great union.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “You mean not like the philosophers,
simply to dream of the good, but like the
artist, to work it out? Didn’t you say that, when
we spoke of choosing the artistic life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “not quite. The philosopher
and dreamer also work for the supreme good, by
showing what it is like, and pointing the way which
men afterward go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I always thought,” said Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “the philosopher is the teacher
of teachers. But I chose the artistic way of viewing
life, because it combines the philosophic and the scientific
way, the vision and the work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia now said: “But sometimes men who work
for completeness, and whose motives are all good,
do harm, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jesus, for instance,” she said. “He has done so
much harm throughout the ages, which he never
meant to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not he who did the harm,” I answered;
“it was the people who misunderstood him and misused
his words. No great man ever does all that he
sets out to do. He cannot, since his aim is no less
than perfection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate perfect people,” said Virginia, “or to think
of any great man as perfect, because it is so inhuman.
I read a book for children, lately, about
Jesus, which made him out a perfect child. It was
full of contradictions, for it said first that he was
a wonder, who walked, talked and thought earlier
than other children, and then it said that he was
human, and understood all human weaknesses. I
think that to know men a man must have human
weaknesses and imperfections.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said; “and I never thought of Jesus as
unhumanly perfect. He, too, had his temptation and
weakness to fight and overcome. Indeed, only the
petty man could be perfect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he would not be perfect,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered; “but according to his standard,
he might think himself so. The great man, the Jesus,
the Lincoln, could never be perfect, for his perfection
could only come with the completeness and beauty
and goodness of the whole world. You said of Jesus
that he did harm, because the doctrine made from
his words did harm. But you must see that until all
men are great men, every man must suffer so. Take
Lincoln, for instance. If he had lived, and kept control
of the Government, surely the evils of the reconstruction
period would have been avoided. You
might say, then, that Lincoln did harm, because his
work led to all that wrong and unhappiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it has all come right now,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly,” I answered; “it is not nearly right, even
to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I suppose,” Virginia said, “that finally the
work of Jesus and of every great man will come
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Lincoln’s work,” said Florence, “will come
right sooner, because it is not so large as the work
of Jesus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I said I wanted to go on to a subject which
seemed to me especially interesting, the question of
the making of laws and regulations. Was it not
a curious thing that men’s minds, outrunning their
other powers, should see clearly the great good for
which they strove, and should make regulations for
themselves, which they were even unable to keep?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry and Ruth did not think it at all curious that
people should make regulations for themselves, but
it did seem strange that they were unable to keep
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To me,” I said, “it seems a wonderful thing that
the sense of beauty and fitness should be so strong
in the mind of man, should so far outrun his impulses
and his body, that he creates for himself laws and
regulations which he then tries to follow, as one sets
up a ladder which he afterward tries to climb. Of
course, we no longer believe in revelation, in the old
Biblical sense, but to us it means revelation from
within. We do not believe that God dictated his
laws to Moses, but that Moses created his laws from
his own sense of love and beauty. Man made his
own laws. And his laws outrun him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people,” said Ruth, “make laws for the
other people, who are not up to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Henry said; “isn’t it really all the people
making laws for themselves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “for finally it is the few making
laws for all, for themselves, too. It is humanity
making laws for humanity. Every time a man does
wrong and knows he is doing wrong, he is breaking
one of his self-made or self-chosen laws. His mind
outruns his powers. When Coleridge wanted to break
himself of the opium-eating habit, he used to hire
men to stand in front of the drug-stores and prevent
his going in. He tried to overcome himself with
himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like Coleridge,” said Virginia. “I like people
with weaknesses, who try to overcome them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I liked them, too, that there was no sight
so stimulating as that of fights and conquests, as seeing
the very thing we longed for, the opposition
beaten, the difficulties overcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But even the weak people who fail to win,” said
Virginia; “I like them, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” I answered; “the fight itself, even the
failure, the human longing, is worth while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want you to see clearly one thing about all
laws and regulations, and that is that they are substitutes.
They are substitutes for understanding love,
or, rather, they are the forerunners of understanding
love, the path of beauty and fitness which the mind
makes for itself before all our desires are strong and
harmonious enough to fulfil the supreme desire. Laws
are the framework on which the house of love shall
be built. But when the house is finished, the framework
shall no more be seen; nor is it of value in itself,
but only as that which upholds the house. I
would like to talk with you of certain special laws
of this kind. And the first is justice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just going to say that,” said Ruth; “it was
on my lips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking of it, too,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry,” I answered, “that I did not give you
the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We talked of this subject, and agreed that although
justice, the sense of equity, was a great and necessary
virtue and a serviceable tool, it was but the tool
of love, and less than love, and that if our understanding,
our sympathy and possession of life were
complete, we would no longer think of justice, nor
praise it; that the rigid laws of justice, which must
oftentimes change, were forever at the service of
love, which made changes and overcame laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people are not so far advanced as others,”
said Virginia, “and the others lift them up with laws.
Some people are undeveloped, like animals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We could not help laughing at Virginia, with her
eternal animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember,” I said, “I spoke to you of past
virtues that were good in their time, because the time
was ripe only for them, and that in their own setting
interest and delight us, and remain forever beautiful,
like old pictures, but which would now be ugly, bad
and out-of-place. Revenge is an example. How the
old stories of revenge stir and even uplift us, and
yet how hateful is the idea of revenge in modern
life! You remember being thrilled and stirred by
the heroism of some old duel, whereas you could
find no beauty or heroism in any duel at the present
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Ruth, “it is often the language in
which the thing is put that stirs us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the spirit of the time and place,” I said.
“No language could make a duel in New York, among
educated people, inspiring or heroic. With war it
is the same. Old wars and wars among savages may
inspire us, because of the heroism and comradeship
of the fighters. But among modern nations even
the justified war must be somewhat disgusting, because
now far more heroism is required in other
works, and comradeship can mean no less than all
mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said I, “can any of you think of another
virtue, like justice, which is a substitute for understanding
love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Florence; “I think that pity is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pity?” I said. “Yes—perhaps. Still, that is
somewhat different. Pity was good once, because
it was feeling, and feeling is the root of all understanding
and sympathy. But self-torturing pity seems
to me a weakness. Sympathy is quite a different, a
stronger, a braver thing. Who agrees with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, they said, would I explain exactly what I
meant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sympathy seems to me understanding and love,
such as you have for yourself. You are willing to
suffer, since it is a part of life and a part of the
way. You want to suffer for the cause, if necessary;
not otherwise. But you don’t pity yourself. You
would be ashamed to make so much of your pain.
So you do not pity others. You love them, you feel
with them, you help them bravely. You can bear
their pain without making a fuss over them, as you
would bear your own. You consider them as strong
and brave as yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all agreed with me, save Virginia. She said:
“If I step by accident on the foot of a little dog, and
he cries out, then that hurts me. And I think it is
good, because then I know how I would feel if I
were a little dog, and I try not to do it again. Isn’t
that pity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” I said; “we are apt to pity lower creatures.
But there is no good in the mere feeling of
physical pain that goes with such things, of the pain
and thrill up and down your spine when you hurt
any creature accidentally, and hear it cry out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think,” asked Alfred, “it is only because
they cry out that we feel it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” I said, “for the cry makes us know of
the pain. At one time, however, a virtue was made
of the mere suffering <span class='it'>with</span> others; and I suppose in
its good time this was necessary, because it developed
the feeling which makes sympathy possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is good,” said Virginia, “for when my
sister was ill, I did not know how she felt, or understood
her, and so I couldn’t sympathize with her;
but later I understood, and then I wished I had felt
with her as she did. It would have been better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” I said, “for it would have taught you
to feel. To know how others feel is the best thing
in the world. But to let that feeling overcome and
crush you, to pity them, is weakness. I think it is
a weakness we have all felt, and longed to overcome,
when we suffered so much with others that we were
unable to act.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be strong to help and strong to do, not overcome
with world-sorrow,” I said, “to face suffering
in ourselves and others as something to be overcome
and used!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia spoke of a curious calmness in herself
that made her not act excitedly when anything happened,
but always wait first to see the outcome. “If
a child falls in the street,” she said, “I don’t go
rushing toward it as some people do, but wait to see
if it will pick itself up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if it fell out of a window,” said Ruth, “I
suppose you would rush forward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she answered, “not unless it were necessary.
I would wait to see what happened. When my hat
blows off, I never go rushing after it till I see where
it is going to stop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The juxtaposition of a falling child and a falling
hat was disconcerting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know how Virginia feels,” I said; “it is the
artist in her always looking on at all that happens.
It is a good way, too. Now what other virtues are
there, like justice, that are really substitutes for right
feeling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They could not think of the others. So I mentioned
honesty, which is much like justice—even a
form of it; steered clear of a reef of arguments on
truth-telling, showed them how honesty would not
even be mentioned where there was perfect love, and
went on to the next and most important, namely,
duty. They had not thought of it in this way before.
They all disliked the word duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke again of the girl who stays home from
the theatre with some one she does not love, because
she feels it to be her duty. Why does she do it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because she chooses,” said Alfred; “she wants to
do it most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She may think,” said Ruth, “that the other person
would do the same for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she may not think so,” I said, “and still she
would stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” said Virginia, “she would feel good
afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “in a sense it is that. It would give
her satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would do it,” said Ruth, “but I don’t think I
would feel any particular satisfaction afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I said, “if you didn’t do it, you would feel
dissatisfied with yourself. And therein lies the explanation
of duty. Duty is a substitute for love. It
is the substitute the mind imposes on us when our
feelings will not fulfil the scheme of beauty and order
which is our strongest desire. To do your duty is to
fulfil your strongest desire—lacking the great love.
Love shall overcome duty. Duty means only debt.
It is limited, small. It is the ugly framework that
love must make before it can build its beautiful dwelling-place.
The strong man always does his duty,
because he flinches at nothing that is on the path, but
more and more he loses duty in love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I think it is fun sometimes to
hate things, such as hating to go to school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because to do a thing you hate to do makes you
feel good sometimes. I like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have come to love the hard thing,” I said,
“because it is the growing thing. We get to fancy
that when we do something hard we must be getting
ahead, because generally it is true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I like the poem by Rebecca of
Sunnybrook Farm:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>‘When joy and duty clash,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Let duty go to smash.’”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish joy and duty were the same,” I said, “and
that is just what they are when love conquers. You
have to do your duty when love fails, and so it often
seems an unpleasant job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke now of promises, and of how unnecessary
they would be were it not for our failures in love.
Then we went on to speak of obedience. We said
that where love was perfect one would not think of
obedience or disobedience. Obedience is a substitute
for understanding. He who understands does
not obey. He acts. We spoke of necessary obedience,
the substitute, and then of the family where
parents and children were so much at one that obedience
was never mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A person out of such a home,” said Virginia,
“would not have enough to struggle against. I don’t
like people who are just perfect, and have nothing to
overcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will never reach perfection,” they said; and
they all, save Henry, agreed with me that the greatest
joy in life was working for, rather than achieving
our desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when we reach perfection,” he said, “we won’t
wish for it any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refused to argue that problematic point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Be sure the strong and good man will
always find something still to fight and overcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke now of how disobedience might be a
virtue, of the rebels in wars for freedom, and the
child who would refuse to obey his parents, if they
ordered him to do what he thought bad; the thief’s
child, for example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “The framework is for the house—not for
itself—and if it doesn’t suit the house, it must be
pulled down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we had an amusing talk on conventions, in
which Henry objected to full-dress suits, bouillon cups
and polite lies. But I showed them how good and
necessary were conventions properly used, since they
saved us weighty discussions on trivial matters. I
said it was a good thing we didn’t have to waste time
and energy deciding what we would eat for breakfast
each day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Henry, “if some day I don’t care to
eat oatmeal for breakfast, I don’t want to feel
obliged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I said; “don’t be a slave to convention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on: “If all things were right, then conformity
would be good—though uninteresting—but
in this growing world we need reformers who smash
and reform things, whenever conformity becomes deformity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You notice that Alfred spoke more at this meeting.
I had told him that if he did not help us along, and
show what he meant and thought, he was not living
up to our idea of completeness and work in unison.</p>

<div><h1><a id='fourteen'></a>FOURTEENTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I read Henry’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good man will bring those with whom he comes
in contact into harmonious relations with himself.
It is not enough to have a good heart. Many people
are always meaning to do good, but never do it. It
is the actions that count; for we said: ‘Art (good)
is self-expression and self-fulfilment.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many things which we call virtues are only substitutes
for love and sympathy, which we are outgrowing.
The principal ones are justice, honesty,
conformity, obedience and pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men have not perfect sympathy, but often do
things at the expense of others. Therefore man,
realizing his weakness, has made for himself a set of
laws.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I objected to his use of the word “pity” along with
the other substitutes. We had another short talk on
the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I would rather commit suicide
than be pitied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” I answered, “since we do not wish to be
pitied, we could not, with perfect sympathy, do so
unto others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia went on: “When a person who has some
trouble or loss makes a great fuss over it, I must say
I don’t think very well of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We expect people to bear life bravely,” I said,
“and to help them do it, to do it altogether. A man
who is prevented from helping by his own pity is like
a man who, when he saw another blind, put out his
own eyes in sorrow, instead of leading the blind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I wanted to speak of a subject that seemed
especially to interest Virginia. I meant patriotism,
but patriotism in a large and unusual sense. What
were their ideas on this subject? Virginia implied
that patriotism was not good, “because whenever you
are patriotic for your own country, you have to be
patriotic against other countries. You seem to be
praising and helping your own at the expense of
others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” I said, “is just the trouble with the false
view of patriotism, and that view has grown out of
wars and conquests. For, naturally, whenever people
fought for their country, they had to fight against
another. But I see patriotism—and any loyalty or
faithfulness—in a larger relation. Think for a moment
what the word patriotism really means, in its
verbal root, and you will see how it grows, how it
begins at home, and ends by including the world.
What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry remembered that it came from a word meaning
“Father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “it meant, originally, loyalty to our
fathers, to our family; and so you must see what it
would finally mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” asked Ruth, “we are related to the
whole world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “we are related to the whole
world, we are children of all the nations; but most
of all, of course, children of our fathers; so that,
beginning at the centre, we shall spread to all sides,
yet not lose the centre. The definite thing, the love
for this land, this home, will come first, and include
all the others. We will be patriotic for our Father,
the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose,” asked Marian, “that an Englishman
could be patriotic for the United States?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “and I am glad you asked that, for
it gives me a chance to tell you what forms patriotism
is beginning to take. An Englishman, or American,
may be patriotic for Anglo-Saxonism all the
world over; for the English language and literature
everywhere; he may dream of it as the world-language;
and then, surely, he is patriotic for these
States, as well as for England. I am not going to
preach patriotism to you. I know you are all patriotic
for this country, for Americanism, for the idea
of democracy which America upholds. Surely the
schools, from first to last, dwell so much upon it
that an American child can hardly help being patriotic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was surprised at the burst of answers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said, on the contrary, the school with its
continual, boring insistence on patriotism, almost
made one hate it; that no children liked to sing the
patriotic songs. Ruth objected that singing patriotic
songs was not patriotism. Alfred, Marian and
Ruth spoke of the boredom of patriotic holiday celebrations
in school, how the well-known men got up
and, as Alfred put it, “said the same thing each
time.” Marian said they had patriotism “thrown
at them in chunks.” Florence added, she thought
we felt unpatriotic, because we didn’t want to be
like those who expressed that kind of patriotism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We concluded, however, that after all we were
patriotic in spite of the schools, and that America
stood for something big, definite, wonderful. I told
them that if only they had been away from it more,
they would understand it better. And they all admitted
that America, insulted with false criticism,
would arouse them like a personal insult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picture, with its central, definite object, still
suggests universal things. So one must begin with
loyalty to first things, to family and State, before
one can be loyal to the universe. I spoke of those
French Socialists whose patriotism for the whole
world had carried them to the point of unpatriotism
to France, so that in a war they would wish to see
their own country destroyed. Their loyalty to working-men
the world over made them careless of the
state at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only to working-men!” cried Virginia. “But
I think one need be just as loyal to the rich, and that
they are quite as much in need of reform and help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said she could understand those French Socialists
very well, and to her it seemed that from their
own point of view they might be right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered: “From their own point of view, of
course. And they do want final, universal good; but
they don’t see that to gain the large one must preserve
the small, that the universal must begin with
the particular.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like some philosophers,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We discussed the subject of war—all disbelieving
in it—without coming to any definite conclusion as to
what we would do under any particular circumstance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia asked whether it would be wrong of a
man, if his country went to war, to refuse to fight
because he disbelieved in war. Henry said he thought
it would be better to do as the fighting Quakers did,
to fight, so that the war might soon be ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said if all people refused to fight, war would
end. I agreed with her, but said also: “If a man
disbelieves in fighting, still, when he is struck, he
defends himself—that is, if he has any spirit. So
I would expect a man, no matter what his convictions,
to defend his country when it is threatened and attacked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think,” they asked, “that Russians can
be patriotic for Russia?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “and that is a patriotism of which
we have not yet spoken, or perhaps thought. It is
the patriotism that seems unpatriotic. The Russian
revolutionists are patriotic, not for the Russia of
to-day, but for the Russia that will be, for the Russia
they are going to build, for the nation in their hearts.
Often the most patriotic man is he who criticizes his
country, who fights against the present state of things,
who appears disloyal because his loyalty is large.
Such were the colonists, loyal to the union and independence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quoted that slogan at the time of the Spanish-American
war: “My country, right or wrong, my
country still.” They were indignant at such an appeal,
and agreed with me that blind loyalty was slavishness.
I told a story to illustrate what I meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suppose a family to be in grave debt, but careless
about paying, and unwilling to make sacrifices. One
member, with the family honor at heart, insists on
these sacrifices and hardships for all, until the debts
are paid. His brothers and sisters may accuse him
of unkindness and disloyalty, but he will be the truly
loyal one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I asked, what was the next law in art?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry brought out his paper and read: “Must
leave out the unimportant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “and the next one reads: Must
have variety and many-sidedness. Do you understand
at all how these apply to life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean,” asked Marian, “that we are
never to do anything unimportant, that we are always
to be thinking about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “certainly not. But I mean
that we are to have a definite aim in life, that we
are to know what we want most of all. Then we can
avoid everything which interferes with this aim. We
are to choose the sort of life that will help us to be
what we wish to be, that will make us whole and
harmonious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what I want to be,” said Marian.
“I don’t think one need have a definite conscious
aim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not quite understand me, Marian,” I answered.
“You need not choose now what your profession
will be, or what definite thing you want most.
Very few people as young as you have done that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “Florence has.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Florence?” I asked. “She said she loved most
to be loved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all do,” said Henry; “to be loved, and to
love others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like,” said Florence, “to dance as well
as my dancing teacher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I expressed grave doubts as to the permanence of
this ambition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I said, “what I mean, Marian, is that you
want to be a certain kind of person, that you must
have an idea of yourself which, even unconsciously,
you try to attain; and it is this ideal, this vision of
the self you wish to be, and mean to be, that should
color and shape your life, as an artist’s idea of his
central figure and meaning controls his whole execution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I don’t think of it all the time,” she
said; “I like just to live along, and dream, and be
what I happen to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Marian,” I answered, “you are saying what
you think is true. But I will show you that it is not.
You live for your desired self, even unconsciously.
Do you not remember doing or leaving undone certain
little things which your ideal of yourself wanted
otherwise, and then reproaching yourself for days
for this small lapse into selfishness or unkindness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had all had this annoying experience, as
well as I myself. Marian told how, when she was
quite a small girl, something had happened that she
had never forgotten. A little beggar-girl, with only
rubbers over her stockings, came to the door and
asked Marian for old clothes. Marian had been
reading stories, and was longing to act them. But
her mother was out, and she had not the courage to
do anything; so she turned the child away with a
mumbled excuse about her mother’s not being at
home. And she had never forgiven herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian saw that what I meant by a definite aim in
life was, after all, indefinite enough to suit her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “When I want to do some kind
or good thing which it is hard to do, because I lack
courage, I make up my mind that I will do it anyway,
without thinking; I walk right in, and then
the rest is always easy and pleasant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In other words,” I answered, “you manage yourself.
I do believe it is good to know what you want
to be, and how you want to be it, and then to avoid
strenuously everything that interferes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of wasted and worthless conversation
with “outsiders,” and I warned them all against boring
people, or allowing themselves to be bored. It
is better not to talk at all. Virginia said she always
made people amuse her, which seemed to us a good
way. I suggested getting people to tell of themselves,
since all human nature is interesting. But
Ruth objected that people who did it were the worst
bores, and only conceited people <span class='it'>would</span> do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate,” I said, “please don’t get into the
habit of making flat conversation, for then you yourselves
will degenerate into bores.” And we decided
that merriment would cover many ills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of the worth of knowledge. The boys
and girls have to study subjects unprofitable to them,
for the sake of passing certain examinations. This,
of course, is a definite sacrifice for a definite reason.
But it is necessary, in all studying, to choose some
subjects and to sacrifice others. I said I would very
much like to know everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Henry answered, “I always wish I might
know everything there is to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, of course, we can’t,” I said, “and so we have
to choose first that knowledge which we need, which
will make our life as we wish it to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred told us how he had chosen to study French
and German instead of Latin, because they seemed
more necessary to him, though he would like to know
them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” I said, “the thing you love you shall seek
with your might. You must definitely want to be a
certain sort of a person in life, else you may be no
sort of person. Have you noticed how some people,
who were quite charming in youth, ‘peter out’ when
they grow older, how they lose all interest in things,
and become dull? To me that seems unnecessary.
Age may be just as full, interesting and active as
youth, to those whose life has a definite aim and
meaning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “Yes, I wish to live long. I have
heard people say they would not like to be old, and
to be a burden to others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you,” I answered, “mean to live long and
not be a burden to others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must concentrate,” I went on; “you must
get out of life only what you need and want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said she couldn’t concentrate in her
studies, except when she loved them. Naturally, I
answered, it was strong love that made us concentrate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I used to study, only instead of
studying I looked out of the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now, at your art,” I answered, “you work
with concentration, because you love it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry remarked that perhaps, when she was looking
out of the window, she studied the landscapes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point Marian, hearing voices in the next
room, whispered to Ruth whether she knew who was
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange,” I said. “Until you spoke of it, I did
not notice any voices. Do you love this club? Well,
I do, too; and when I am here, no matter what
happened before, or will happen afterward, or may
be happening now, I think of nothing but what we
are doing, I forget everything else. Do you remember
the difference between the painting and the
photograph? The photographic plate takes every
detail, unimportant and meaningless; the picture contains
only that which makes it complete and beautiful.
Let your life be a picture, not a photograph. Do
not let your life be a sensitive plate that cannot defend
itself against any impression. Let it be an
artist’s work, chosen, complete, beautiful. Leave out
what does not concern you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what is it,” I asked, “which all of us do
love best, and which includes all our lesser loves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry answered: “You mean complete sympathy
and understanding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I went on, “and all our lives are different,
definite expressions of that desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke a few words of those people who mistake
the means for the end, who make an end of
business, athletics, or even study, so that they forget
these are only a means to the end, and destroy or
waste their own powers in some pettiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Each life,” I said, “must be a different, definite
expression of the longing for unity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Definite?” asked Marian again. “If I were always
to be thinking what sort of person I meant to
be, I would be dreadfully self-conscious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I said, “you would not think it, you would
live it. Desire is a habit. Self-consciousness of the
stilted sort attempts to realize what sort of person
you appear or are, and then to act your part. Then
you usually fail, and you are usually wrong in your
estimate. But know what you long to be; and then
be it, because of your strong desire. It is not necessary
to have chosen your life-work now, but you will
choose it some day, and meanwhile you want to be
ready and open for it. You and Alfred have not
yet chosen, nor need choose. But the others believe
they have chosen. And there is no reason why each
one should not do just what he sets out to do. Each
life and each moment of each life is tremendously important.
Each man is as great as he loves to be.
The difference between the great genius and the
common, scattered man, is the difference in desire.
Great desire makes great deeds. It is not so much
capacity, so called, as the desire, the concentration
and the belief that you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Self-confidence,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, surely. When a man has his call, when he
feels that he must do a thing, then he can. Did you
ever think of the word ‘calling,’ what a tremendous
thing it means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vocation,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “your vocation. Some of us have
our call early, and some late, but we can always follow
it to the end with love and courage. I believe
that each one of you is going to do great things. I
want you to believe that you are going to be great,
for then you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “I mean to be a great man. I know
I can, if I work for it. When some one found fault
with me for criticizing Lincoln, because I was nobody,
I answered that I meant to be greater than
Lincoln. And I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you shall. And I believe that Virginia will
be as great an artist as she means to be. And I believe
that if Florence persists, she shall dance better
than Isadora Duncan, and make of dancing a great
and noble art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> so,” said Marian and Ruth. “It is an expression
of the highest art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely it is,” I said. “And I believe that Ruth
will reform the whole kindergarten system, and give
us new and finer ideas on education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe it and know it, too,” said Marian; “she
had her call early. She has always been teaching
little children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ambition is good,” I said; “it is best. He who
desires great things will do greatly. Genius is desire.
And great genius is most desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Each one,” I said, “will then be a person with a
meaning, but for all that a large, many-sided person.
Do you understand, Marian? In a picture there is
light and shade, and contrast makes completeness.
So in life, rest and work and play, merriment and
seriousness, study and exercise, and all the many
different things that make up life are needed to make
it whole. I believe in concentration, in variety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean,” asked Florence, “by concentration
in variety?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean,” I said, “that we will make every activity
in life the sort we need, that our pleasures will suit
our studies. Our taste and liking in every kind of
thing will harmonize. We will like only good nonsense.
Even our recreation must have a certain character,
and satisfy our taste. Each person stands for
a definite vision of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “At the academy show last year,
you remember that picture by Pischoto of an Italian
garden, with a fountain? It was calm, the water
poured down softly, all was still. At the Spanish
exhibition, I saw a picture by Sorolla of the same
spot; but it was jubilant, the water leaped, the sun
sparkled, everything was gay. It was the difference
in temperament that made the same spot unlike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said; “I am glad you told us that. For
I believe each person must be a rhythm in life, must
stand for himself, and be a force and a measure of
life to those about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke a few words more, to make this clear;
and then I read to them two slips from the Ruskin
calendar, which Ruth had brought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that is highest in Art, all that is creative and
imaginative is formed and created by every artist
for himself, and cannot be repeated or imitated by
others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember that it is of the very highest importance
that you should know what you are, and determine
to be the best that you may be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next meeting will be Ruth’s meeting on Christian
Science.</p>

<div><h1><a id='fifteen'></a>FIFTEENTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>We had our meeting on Christian Science.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish to record it in so far only as it related to our
planned work, as I think neither Ruth’s exposition
nor our answers were original or enlightening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had given her a list of topics. The first was the
idea of God. In this we found we agreed, and it gave
occasion for much reviewing. Ruth had translated
all her ideas from the vocabulary of Christian Science
to that of our club, and this helped her to shape
her thoughts. We spoke at some length of the
personal and universal self. They called it “two
selves,” and I answered them that it was only one,
the one including the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the subject and matter and spirit we had some
trouble. They all understood what I said, but failed—I,
too—to understand Ruth; and we are not sure
now whether she and I agree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “Scientists speak of ‘dead matter,’
of all matter as dead. Is that so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I repeated my ideas on spirit and matter—all form
is an expression of spirit—and also insisted on the
limitations of our knowledge. I said: “Matter
seems never to be dead, because when one force takes
leave of it, another comes into possession, and decay
is always the beginning of new life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian answered: “You mean the particles in
this table are held together by a force?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? Does it feel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again I pleaded ignorance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of form as the eternal changing expression
of spirit, of time as merely the measure and
rhythm of progress or change. So Ruth found me
willing to grant that all bad was a condition, not an
unalterable thing, and that time was only a convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning immortality Ruth believed all I do,
and more besides. Alfred now agrees with me. He,
too, feels that in some way he must continue to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the individual—or soul—Ruth thought as I.
We also agreed on moral good and bad, and on the
use and manner of prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian asked me: “Why, if mind force forms
body, can we not make our bodies perfect at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered her that mind force had formed our
bodies in the past, as they were now, and that our
present, mental force was making future physical
conditions; that all things went slowly, and the results
of the past were inevitable. I spoke of the influence
mind and action had on the body, on circulation,
for instance. I said again that physical perfection
could not be the aim, but only one of the conditions
of progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the subject of disease and cure Ruth and I disagreed
entirely. But this we both held to be not tremendously
important. I do not care here to record
the arguments—not in the least bitter or heated—which
we gladly left in air. None of us was in the
least convinced by Ruth, and we were frank—she,
as well as we—in our expressions of opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So we found Ruth was with us in all that mattered,
and had been candidly with us all the while. The
children said the club had not changed their views,
but enlarged and ordered them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I read aloud the Christian Science prayer Ruth
had brought some weeks ago:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>MY PRAYER</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“To be ever conscious of my unity with God, to
listen for his voice, and hear no other call. To
separate all error from my thought of man, and see
him only as my father’s image, to show him reverence
and share with him my holiest treasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To keep my mental home a sacred place, golden
with gratitude, redolent with love, white with purity,
cleansed from the flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To send no thought into the world that will not
bless, or cheer, or purify, or heal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To have no aim but to make earth a fairer, holier
place, and to rise each day into a higher sense of
Life and Love.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We liked all of it, save the words “cleansed from
the flesh.” Ruth explained that this meant cleansed
from the idea of evil in the flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” I answered, “the author should have
said, though it is less poetical, ‘cleansed from the
prejudice against the flesh.’ I would agree with
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia again suggested the subject of animal
consciousness, by telling Mark Twain’s story of the
cat and the Christian Scientist. Ruth said that just
now she was studying this subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence asked: “Do you believe jelly-fish are
conscious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I reminded them of Cope’s theory of consciousness
and desire as the cause of life, and of the higher
consciousness swamping the lower. They remembered
it, and were interested. Virginia said: “It
is like the stars, which are always there, but cannot
be seen when the sun shines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “the light of our larger consciousness
hides those lesser feelings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of other religions and creeds, and Henry
used the term—referring to Unitarianism—“a mild
form of Christianity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian asked me whether mine was an absolute
belief in an absolute truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” she said, “I don’t believe any one can
find the absolute truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must see,” I answered, “that I believe in a
growing truth. Why else had we called ourselves
Seekers? And I believe we will be seekers all our
lives. All I have given you is a direction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not sure,” answered she, “that I want just
one direction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He who would go in all directions at once, must
stand still,” I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I must,” she said. “I believe only one
thing absolutely, and that is that I am immortal.
And I don’t think I believe that just because I like
to.” Still, when I questioned her on the whole self,
and progress toward sympathy as the good, she fully
agreed. She is afraid of accepting too much. This
is a large truth, different <a id='for'></a>for each one, able to include
all, growing, forever changing, and forever the
same, like life itself. I said: “We will always be
Seekers together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now read Henry’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We spent a few minutes in speaking of Patriotism.
Patriotism is loyalty to our fathers, and from
this it comes to be loyalty toward our country, and
then to the whole world. No one should be patriotic
to the extent of ‘My country right or wrong,’ nor
should any one be so patriotic in the cause of humanity
as a whole as to forget his duty to his country
and his home. The patriotic man is not always the
right man, but the man with ‘Firmness in the right
as God gives him to see right.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many people spoil their lives, and even those of
others, by putting unimportant things on a level,
or perhaps higher than the really important questions
of their life. There are women who try to
teach or do settlement work because they think it a
duty, even though they have no taste or ability in
those lines, and their right place is in their own
homes. The farmer who comes to the city and tries
to be a business man, will not, as a rule, succeed.
Every man has some work at which he is best, and
he should find out what his calling is, and then
give his best efforts to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To represent light in a picture, we must have
shadows, and without variation life would be dull.
Hobbies are very good; and if a business man delights
in visiting picture galleries, or baseball games,
he will be better off if he gratifies these hobbies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry’s paper aroused some comment. They criticized
Henry for saying one should not be “so patriotic
in the cause of humanity as a whole as to
forget his duty to his country.” They said patriotism
for humanity must be patriotism for one’s own
land. We agreed that his error was one of words
rather than of meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls teased him about his opinion on woman’s
whole duty, and accused him, truly, it seems, of
being opposed to woman’s suffrage. I said I wished
it were not out of our present plan to argue all those
questions, but we would not discuss definite social or
political problems at all, since the girls and boys
had neither the experience nor the judgment to profit
by them now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean,” asked Marian, “whether the very
rich man ought to keep his money, or throw it out
on the street to everybody?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—if you wish to put it that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am certain,” said Florence, “no one could
change my views on social questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “probably not. But no doubt
you will often change them for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now read Marian’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our discussion last week at the club was on various
subjects. The first was patriotism. We should
be patriotic for our own country and the whole world.
If we are rightly patriotic for our own country, we
will be so for the whole world. It is not patriotism
to say I am for the whole world, but not for my
own country. This would be very inconsistent. Patriotism
does not consist of saying your own country
is always right, and that another is wrong because
it is not your own. We also discussed the question
of choosing professions, and agreed that we should
always choose what we like, whether it is conventional
or not. It is better to be a good dancer than a poor
teacher. In doing work for others, we ought not to
choose settlement work because our friends are doing
it, or because we or some one else thinks we ought
to. If it is work that appeals to us, we should do
it; but, if not, we might go among the young people
of our own circle, and help them. Another thing
we spoke of was <span class='it'>boring</span> and <span class='it'>being bored</span>. Never
bore any one or allow them to bore you. If you don’t
know anything to say worth while saying, keep still.
If some one else bores you, look at them from some
standpoint such that, if they don’t interest you, at
least they make you laugh at them. If possible, don’t
frequent the society of people that bore you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They asked, had I not said it was wrong to laugh
“at” people. Yes, I answered, malicious laughter
was bad, as malicious criticism was bad, but there
was a kindly laughter, that laughed with people, and
smiled at their superficial weaknesses in a loving way
openly, as we smile at our own. In this way we often
laughed at, and with, the people we loved most.
But, I said, let us never forget or disrespect the
self, the growing, wonderful self in every creature,
especially in every human being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Virginia and Marian have their troubles.
They do dislike certain people, and they like talking
about them. Virginia said a fool was a fool, and
continued to be a fool, even if you thought of him
as a developing self. Marian objected that though
she agreed with me, she couldn’t live up to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I am not going to tell you what to do,
or preach you a sermon. Only I want you to see
the thing in a true light. I find it impossible to
sympathize with some people, and I cannot help disliking
those who have done harm to any one I love.
But I look upon it as a weakness and limitation of
myself, which I mean to overcome. Remember that
every self you fail to understand is a limitation of
yourself. Every judgment you make of another is
a judgment of yourself. I wish one could say, not:
‘I hate that person,’ but ‘I am <span class='it'>one who hates</span> that
person’; the hate being a quality of your own, and
reflecting only upon yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have said of people,” said Virginia, “that I
did not see how they could have any friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they did have friends,” I answered, “and the
limitation was in your power of seeing. When you
speak ill of a person, you are defining yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be much pleasanter,” said Virginia, “to
think it was a definition of the other person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt,” I answered; “do as you please, but
remember what you are doing. Realize your limitation
as such, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “I would like to be able to think
of myself as perfect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At once, Marian, dear? Then make a little set
of rules for yourself, and follow them, like the petty
moralists, and be perfect. But we, of the growing
truth, cannot reach perfection. At least, we want to
know what is good, and strive for it. I can tell you
more than I can do, because I see ahead. Let us
remember that with our judgments and sympathies
we are measuring ourselves.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='sixteen'></a>SIXTEENTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I read Henry’s paper, which expressed his point
of view:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This meeting was spent in talking of Christian
Science. We agree that we are seekers for a great
truth and complete harmony, which we call God.
We also agree in believing in immortality, though
we do not know what our existence will be like after
that of our present state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The difference seemed to lie in our idea of matter,
and, as the belief in this is closely connected with
the idea of cure, we did not agree on the latter subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that matter is the creation of spirit;
and science tells us that no matter ever ceases to
exist, though it may change its form. As I understand
it, the Christian Scientist says that what we call
matter is not permanent, and therefore does not exist
at all. But when he says it is not permanent, I
think he only considers it as a definite shape, such as
a house or a table, and he overlooks its different
forms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Christian Scientist’s idea of matter were
correct, his idea of cure would also be correct. I
think he says: ‘There is no matter, and therefore,
there can be no material suffering. Consequently, all
pain and sickness are spiritual conditions.’ To all
those who believe in matter as a real and permanent
thing, this idea is impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I must insist on my ignorance on this
subject. Matter to me seems permanent, a something
that constantly changes form, unknowable except in
form; thus form always seems to me the expression
of an idea, that is, of the spirit. I know matter only
through spirit or consciousness.” They all agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I said, we would go on to the next law in
art, and see what its application might be. Did they
like, I asked, to take up each law of art in turn, and
see what was its relation to life?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Henry said, “and doing so makes the laws
in art much clearer to me. When you tell me their
application to life, it helps me to understand their
meaning in pictures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said I, “depends upon your temperament.
Another might find just the opposite to be true, that
knowledge of the laws of art made them clearer in
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Virginia, “I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next law,” I said, “is: ‘Art must not be
partisan.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me,” said Marian, “the application
of that to life is quite clear already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, how would you explain it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidently one must take sides in life. How, then,
not be partisan? Virginia said: “Everything has
two sides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “and the question is how to use
them both, how to be for, and yet not against. Every
work of art is for something; it stands for beauty,
order, completeness. But it is against nothing. The
moment it stands against something, it is not art.
Lincoln’s life shows so well what I mean. I wonder
whether you will understand how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they did not. Henry said it was because he
stood for the Union, but not against slavery, and
looked upon emancipation as only a side issue, to be
used for the sake of the Union. The others said still
more uncomprehending things, and so forced me to
tell them what I meant. I said Lincoln stood for a
cause, for an idea, and not against any man. He
wanted to win all to his side, to make his side the
whole, the Union. Be for a cause, for a purpose,
mean something, and strive for its fulfilment; but do
not be against persons, against parties. After all,
men can be won only if you are also for them, as
Lincoln was also for the Southerners. He was willing
to work with his political enemies for the Union,
since he felt no enmity to men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Henry, “for his Secretary of State,
Stanley, was his political enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Red Cross nurses are not less at one with
the purpose of their country, though they nurse and
tend with equal kindness the wounded foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” Virginia went on, “Dickens is not a great
artist in those parts of his books where he becomes
bitter, and hates the characters of whom he writes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “surely not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One feels that writer to be much greater,” she
said, “who sympathizes with and understands and
loves even his worst characters. And I think Dickens
has not a good influence in those books where he
arouses hatred of people, and does not help the feeling
of sympathy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of political reforms—they are quite unformed
and uninstructed in social thought—and then
went on to school factions. Was it not true that they
admired most the boy or girl who worked for a
cause, without bitterness against any person? They
spoke of class presidents and school parties, and
discussed the thing among themselves. Ruth said
that the best class president was always the one who
had most enemies, for some girls liking her so
much, many others were sure to dislike her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered: “The person who stands for a
purpose will have many against him, and he will not
care. But he will not be against them. And in the
end he will win, as Lincoln has won the Southerners.
They may still be bitter against the North, but they
join the Northerners in honoring Lincoln, the man,
for they know he worked for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may have noticed that so far we have spoken
of self-development and personal growth; and to
you, at present, that is the most important thing.
But I want to speak a few words of sympathy with
those we do not know, of our relations with the world
of all men.” I said they had too little experience to
form definite ideas on that tremendous, complicated
thing called society. I wanted to give them only a
few of my ideas that might come back to them later,
when they understood more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I want you to think of society as a big
self, as the rest of yourself, as one vast whole, in
which each man in so many mysterious ways affects
each other man, that none can be right until all are
right. Have you ever thought of the relations of
people with other people whom they never know, of
all the things that are done for us by strangers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Florence, “I have thought of it, for
we once spoke of it in another class.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Consider it,” I went on, “this table at which we
sit, the clothes we wear, the food we eat, everything,
everything that we use, is made for us by so many
hands, all related to us and all affected by our need
and use of them. Have you ever thought what the
word Democracy means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, they answered, they knew. Henry said it
meant all people should have their rights. I said
it meant even more. Did they remember the three
old catchwords of Democracy: Equality, Fraternity——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Liberty,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and Liberty. But I do not believe that all
people are equal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Virginia, “I am quite sure they are
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on: “Democracy stands for this, that they
all have the right to be equal. We must grant this,
not for any altruistic reason, but because we need
and want them all, because we want to miss nothing.
We want each one to have the right and the chance
to develop to be the best he may be, because that, too,
will be best for us. And we feel that every living
being is capable of immense development. For there
is one thing in us all that is equal; whether it be big
or little, it is the same in us all, and that is self.
I feel reverence and wonder for self. Every baby
seems marvellous to me for this reason; he is a new
self. And whenever I stop to think, when I am with
strangers, and with people, no matter how uninteresting,
I have the strong feeling of kinship and mystery.
Do you ever feel so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes,” said Virginia. “I feel that way in
snatches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never think about it,” said Marian, “but sometimes
the feeling comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “I feel that way with things more
than with people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, for instance, with the ocean or mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I said, “there you cannot <span class='it'>know</span>. With people
it is so real and close.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trouble is, they cannot feel so with those they
dislike or wish to criticize; and this subject comes
up again and again, with amusing variations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia takes dislikes to faces; Florence cannot
“stand” some people whom she greatly admires;
Marian will not be deprived of the pleasure of
“knocking” one particular girl. From what I gather,
their gossip is not of the malicious sort, and this
over-criticism and sensitiveness is, as I told them, a
weakness and limitation of youth. They have not
yet learned to use the good of people for their own
good. For people in the street, however, they often
have intense sympathy; and kindness for the stranger.
Marian spoke again of the apartment houses behind
her school, with their hundreds of windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would like to tear their walls away, wouldn’t
you,” asked Ruth, “to see what is going on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Marian, “but I can’t help
thinking of all those different lives in there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said whenever her mother saw strangers
who looked as if they liked her, she spoke to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” I answered, “can seldom be done, except
with children; because, you see, the world is not as
we wish it, though it might be better were it so; and
since the other person may not understand, we dare
not try to understand him. Often on a sunny, happy
morning, when I get into a car, I feel like greeting
the motorman, and every person I meet. But how
can I? They would misunderstand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” said Virginia, “that is the motive of
the fresh young men who sometimes try to speak to
you on the street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s just the trouble,” I answered, “that it
isn’t their motive, and so it cannot be ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth told us how at the Christian Science church
that morning she had left something undone which
she regretted. She said: “There was a young man
who did not seem to know any one, and he looked
lonesome and uncomfortable. I felt as if I ought to
go up to him and make him welcome, but I had not
the courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I think you were right,” I answered her, “for
he might not have understood your motive. And yet
again he might. It is hard to tell. I am sorry to
say we have often to wrong people in this matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke of the sufferings and the wrongs of society,
and of how we must realize that these are our sufferings
and our wrongs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marian, “but what can we do? We
can’t do anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is very little we can do, except to be on
the right side, and therefore ready to do. I want to
have you see the thing as it is, to be conscious of the
whole, as your whole self, so that you will act according
to that knowledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think,” asked Marian, “that a great
many people act the same way, without knowing why
they do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “or else they are only half
conscious, or think they have some other motive. But
I believe in being fully conscious, and doing things
with freedom and from conviction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe,” said Marian, “that while I act
I think of why I am acting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “I am quite certain that you
do not, and that you never will. No man thinks
while he acts. The thinking is done long before. And
then the action comes of itself. If you always think
and feel a certain way, the good, true way, you need
not trouble over your actions. They will be right.
Do you suppose the man who gives up his life to
save another thinks of what he is doing, and why?
He is doing what he must. But all his life long he
has been thinking in such a way, and living in such
a way, that no other action would be possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said again the quotation from St. Augustine:
“‘Love God, and do as you please,’ for if you love
the good, wholly, you can do only the good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember,” I said, “that if the contagiously sick
are not cared for, we shall all be ill; and, just so,
starvation, poverty, sin, hurt each one of us, wherever
they be, and must be cured for our own sake. Let
us get over the self-righteous, sentimentally virtuous
feeling which I fear charity has given many people.
For that reason I have always disliked the word
‘charity.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Ruth, “so have I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the virtuous feeling is very pleasant,” Virginia
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly,” I answered, “so sane and sound as the
pleasant feeling of helping ourselves, all together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The word ‘charity,’” said Marian, “comes from
a Greek word meaning gratitude, the word ‘charis.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had always thought of it,” I said, “as coming
from the Latin ‘carus,’ meaning love. But that is
interesting. For gratitude is always a debt paid.
And so, I fear, all our charity is a debt partly and
never wholly paid. The most that a man can give,
being able to give, still leaves him more than his
share. And that is why I seldom have the joy untainted,
of which Virginia speaks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said it made her glad to see people happy
because of her. She said: “Once three of us gave
a little boy a ten-cent plaything, and it made him so
happy we felt as though we had done something fine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth agreed with me that it was impossible to
overcome a feeling of personal guilt at the sight of
misery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” I went on, “that for the rich poverty is
as bad as for the poor. Drunkenness and misery
ask their price of the rich man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Virginia, “for to see poor and drunken
people bothers the rich man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is quite right,” I said; “poverty does and
must bother the rich man, and that is just why he
must get rid of it. Wells, the socialist, once said
he dared not let any man be sick or poor or miserable,
and bring up sick, poor, miserable children, for he
could not tell what man’s grandchild would one day
marry his grandchild.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is an interesting way of looking at it,” said
Marian. “I never thought of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you see,” I went on, “we can no more praise
ourselves for helping to better the world than we
can praise people—except for their good sense and
wisdom—when they put up hospitals for contagious
diseases, and separate those who suffer from them.
Did you ever think of it, that to take care of the
weak strengthens the strong? The man who cares
for two gets the strength of two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence asked: “What if there were no weak?”
A good question, but an unanswerable one, from lack
of experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good,” I went on, “to use our powers, to
strengthen them; and we can use them only through
others. I have heard people say it is foolish for the
strong to spend themselves on the weak. To me
that seems untrue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Virginia, “what is their strength for,
if not to use it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sparta,” I said, “has left no trace but her history,
because she cared only for physical strength, and
wasted the strength and power that are in weakness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish she had not left her history,” they said,
thinking of the hard names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything leaves history,” sighed Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can use all men,” I went on, “and every man
does something for us that we cannot do for ourselves.
The world is like a vast body, in which hand
and head do each its part; and the head shall not
despise the hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like to think of it in that way,” said Ruth,
“to think of different people as different parts of the
body, for some would have to be way down at the
foot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Ruth,” I answered, “I believe you are
despising the foot! That is because you don’t think
well enough of the body. But Florence knows better.
She probably thinks her feet the most important part
of all. When I spoke of the body, I meant that each
part was equally necessary to all the others. But I
suppose each one of us here would like to think of
himself as a brain-cell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We like to flatter ourselves,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke to them of the modern trend in judging
crime and meting punishment. Henry already understood
this. We spoke of “homes” instead of prisons,
of treating the bad as abortive and undeveloped,
as moral idiots and invalids, and of using for our
good and their happiness all the powers they possessed.
We would hate badness, but not the bad
man. How could we? Each one acts according to
his desires, and in that sense selfishly; and our character
depends on how large we are, how much we
desire. The man who wants to be richer than his
neighbor will act otherwise than the man who wants
to share and enjoy the riches and happiness of all
his neighbors, and make the whole world his home.
Our desires are the measure of our growth. And
some are more developed than others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some are so undeveloped,” said Virginia, “that
they seem almost like animals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wondered why Virginia hadn’t mentioned that
sooner,” said Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went on to the next law, that art must give
the impression of truth. How does it apply? I said
they must see that the telling of truth was not the
whole of true relation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there may be even a kind of truth-telling
which is essentially untrue; I mean truth told maliciously,
truth told for the purpose of hurting. That
makes an untrue relation between people, even though
it be true in fact; just as the ugly picture, truly representing
an ugly thing in an ugly way, does not seem
true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “As if one woman said to another
woman: ‘I saw your husband drunk last night,’ and
the other woman knew it already. It would be quite
true, but unnecessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke of the importance of praise and encouragement
to others, and of kind, true criticism. At
first they all protested that they did not like over-much
praise. No, I said, not over-much, nor praise alone;
I hated to be “damned with faint praise,” but I loved
praise and blame combined in such measure, that I
felt the thing done was worth doing, and yet saw
where it was wrong, and how it might be righted.
I said all teachers ought to praise and blame in this
fashion—never forgetting the praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t have time for it in school,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth,” I answered her, “just for a teacher of
small children, such encouraging critical power is
most necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, “I know. I mean to have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on: “When I criticize a child’s drawing,
for instance, and find six wrong lines in it, and one
right line, I will insist on the worth of that right
line, and show how the other six can and ought to
be made equally good. One can always point to
the wrong, without hurting, when one insists on the
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now we passed to a difficult and engrossing
subject: what things are worth while in personal
social life. At this period of life it concerns the
girls chiefly; but it could not be skipped for that
reason. And the boys were interested listeners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke again of “prettiness” in art. Did they remember?
Virginia said, those painted merely prettily
who tried to please the crowd for the sake of
money or applause. Yes, I answered, they tried to
please those who could not understand them or truly
judge them. And so there is a prettiness of manner
and life which appeals to the stranger and acquaintance,
but does not win the friend; the merely social
prettiness, that has no true worth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What did I mean? asked Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean,” I said, “a mixing of values—giving up
what is worth more, for what is worth less, and,
usually, because we don’t realize what we are doing.
For instance, ever so many will go to much greater
trouble to please acquaintances than friends, and even
ask their friends to ‘let them off’ for the sake of their
acquaintances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is,” said Florence, “because we know our
friends will forgive us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “and it is a poor reason, for
finally we will not have any to forgive us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know a girl,” said Marian, “who has ever so
many acquaintances, and no friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I think of society,” Virginia said, “in the
large sense of all people, the only class I don’t think
of as belonging to society, are just the society girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” I answered, “is foolish; for they do belong
to it, and can be a very important part of it, if
they wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian looked puzzled. “It is all right,” she
asked, “isn’t it, for girls to go into society?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” I answered; “not only all right, but very
good, if they do it in the best way. But I think it a
terrible waste for girls to do nothing but go into
society, to live only for that, and rest only for that,
and care only for the superficial show of it, for luxury
and money-spending.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of luncheons and parties, and all sorts
of festivities where decoration and show count, and
tried to put decoration in its subordinate place. “People
are apt,” I said, “to lose the real thing in the
glamor, to care to outdo each other only in expensiveness
and show, instead of remembering that pleasant
surroundings are merely surroundings. Like the
woman who would spend all her time on her household,
and waste herself to make it beautiful, instead
of remembering that its beauty could count only as a
setting for herself and her greater work. It’s a pity
to waste good art on poor subjects.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One must be all-sided,” said Marian, “you told
us so. I know a girl who did college and society and
housekeeping all at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all well?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so,” she answered, “though I’m not so
sure about the college part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is just the danger,” I said, “and a danger
I wish you all to avoid. I don’t want one of you,
when you leave school, to degenerate into a frivolous,
silly society girl. You won’t, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all said they wouldn’t. Virginia and Ruth
were positive they couldn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” I went on, “many girls do it who
seemed serious and intelligent while at school. I will
tell you why they do. They are apt to think school
in itself so intellectual, that they particularly avoid,
at other times, thinking seriously or reading good
books or having sensible conversations. And, indeed,
school does keep them thinking, but not of their own
accord. So, when they are graduated, they stop all
thinking, go into society, and wait to get married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And some women,” said Marian, “get so uninteresting
after they marry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “it is true, and it is a pity.
Naturally, every girl expects to marry, and has the
right to expect it. But if she folds her hands and
waits for it, or goes out and dances and waits for it,
she will hardly be fit when the time comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is disgusting,” said Marian, “for a girl
to be ‘on the market.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” I answered. “And no wonder that
those girls, when they marry, become dull and ‘settled,’
and do not grow with their children. For, you
see, they were ‘finished’ when they left school. I
believe that when a girl leaves school she should go
on working and growing and learning all her life
long, whether she marry or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I have learnt so many, many
things since I left school last year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” they answered, “at art school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, “I don’t mean that. I learn more
out of school than in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The independent woman,” I said, “who has some
work and aim, who can support herself if need be,
and who does some definite work in life, whether or
not she supports herself, will not stagnate when she
marries, because she has been growing all the time.
When her children grow up, she will grow with them,
and learn and change and think all her life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must she do some definite thing?” asked Henry
skeptically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “I know you think, Henry, that
she should be good and help around the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” I said, “that she must have a definite
thing to do in life, though not necessarily to support
herself by money-making. She may study, if she
should wish to prepare for more difficult work, or
she may have a household of people to care for, and
even other people’s children to bring up, just as a
married woman might.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good manners and politeness next engaged our attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth is a great stickler for manners, especially in
boys, and not a very good judge of character, so
she has to make much of evident, superficial characteristics.
Marian, on the other hand, is an excellent
judge of character. Marian asked me whether I
thought manners important, and what I thought politeness
meant. I said good manners were the natural
expression of kindness, but that one often met good
people who were bores, nevertheless, simply out
of awkwardness; that many young boys were so,
and Ruth ought to teach them better. We quoted
some examples of false good manners, good simply
for effect, which usually were self-exposed at last. I
said: “That people with kind manners are thought
the best-bred and finest, is but another sign that the
world of men goes in ‘our’ direction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marian, “I see how you mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth granted she cared too much for good manners,
since they did not always mean what they professed
to mean. To Florence they seemed unimportant,
in others, as an index of character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence said: “I act differently with each person,
because I believe a different way will please each
person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “we all do it unconsciously;
and that is why we <span class='it'>are</span> as many people as we <span class='it'>know</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went on: “When I am with people who like
to be serious, I talk seriously; and when I am with
people who like to fool, why, then I am jolly and
silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how about your own taste and personality?”
I asked. “Does that count?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I am with some very proper people,” said
Florence, “I love to shock them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “it is a temptation. But,
please, Florence, make the people do what you choose
sometimes. You remember that you want to be like
a picture, and not only like a looking-glass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like to be the controlling person,” said Virginia,
“and make people do what I choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said: “I don’t believe people are ever their
real self with me, and it is very annoying. They always
try to seem better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is,” said Marian, “because they know you
have such high ideals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Ruth went on, “I suppose <span class='it'>you</span> tell them.
And then they show me only their good side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth,” I answered, “if that be true, it need not
trouble you. If you can really make people always
show you their good side, you should be glad to have
the power. For people’s good side is a pleasanter
side to see; and it is excellent practice for them to
show it. I want you each to be a power and a purpose
in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterward I had a little talk with Florence. I
said: “I am afraid I was speaking for your benefit.
Do you mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she answered, “but I am not going to be
that sort of society girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I walked homeward with Virginia and Henry. Virginia
told me that the club made her think, that
things we said came back to her weeks and weeks
afterward, and gave new meanings to life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next week we are going to have the last meeting.
Henry asked me whether we were going to speak of
“Aloofness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “and it will include all we have
said until now.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='seventeen'></a>SEVENTEENTH MEETING</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I read Henry’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We should not be partisan. Do not fight against
any one as an enemy, but as a friend who tries to help
another, by thwarting his wrong purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again we can go to Lincoln for an example.
When he was president, Lincoln sent to his great
political enemy, Douglas, and asked for his aid in
the approaching struggle. Again, when the war was
almost over, and those about him said that the Southern
leaders would have to be severely dealt with,
he told them that though he could not avoid the
hated war, now that their end had been gained, he
wanted peace, and bore no malice toward his Southern
countrymen, whom he would deal with as leniently
as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I read Marian’s paper:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At our last meeting of the Seekers we took up the
application of the two next-to-the-last principles of
Art to life. The first, ‘do not be partisan,’ we understood
easily. But how to stand for a cause without
being partisan, is more difficult to understand.
By this we mean being for a cause but not against
another, and being broad-minded enough to understand
the other side. In doing this all personal attacks
are, of course, eliminated. The next principle,
that art gives the impression of truth, when applied
to life means being, first, truth-telling. However, if
by telling the truth we unnecessarily wound a person,
we had better say nothing. To tell the truth for the
purpose of hurting some one is almost as bad as telling
a lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I thought it was almost worse. I asked why
had Henry and Marian both left out an important
part of our last meeting, the part on our larger social
relations? Had we not made it impressive enough?
For a moment they all were puzzled. Was it at
the last meeting we had spoken of that? When I
reminded them of what had been said, they remembered.
But Henry added: “I did not think we said
it at the last meeting. It seemed longer ago. Perhaps
because that is something we have spoken of
at all the meetings, right along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I thought all but Alfred and Ruth were not
greatly interested in larger social questions. Their
family and school life were more absorbing. I said:
“I know Alfred is interested in social and political
problems, because he has told me so. You see, even
though he won’t talk to you, he does sometimes talk
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred blushed. He answered: “I care more
about those outside relations than anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “I am interested, too. But last
time, just in the midst, we got off to the subject of
‘knocking’ people. And so I don’t think we quite
finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” I asked, “we had better go over it
again to-day? And yet I think not. You do seem
to understand. I don’t think you can form your social
and political opinions now, and I don’t care to talk
much of these things. You see, the boys still have
five years before they need to vote. And for the
girls, I imagine it may be even longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Ruth, “I don’t think it will
be much longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I went on, “we spoke of other things, too.
Didn’t we speak a great deal of woman’s life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean choosing professions, and society, and
so on?” asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is strange, too,” said she, “that I forgot to
write about it. For it impressed me very much, and
I was talking of it only the other day, when some
girls were at the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” I said, “we will speak of that strange
thing, aloofness, the spectator’s point of view, that
a while ago you could not understand. And I think
to-day you will understand at once, for it is the sum
and completeness of all we have said. Do you think
you know now what I mean by aloofness? What do
you think, Henry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it means,” he said, “understanding with
sympathy all the people about you, and the outsiders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said; “but it means more than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred looked as if he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Alfred?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t it mean,” he asked, “being able to criticize
and judge yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said. “That is nearer; it means both,
and more than both. It means being not only in yourself,
but above and around, judging all things as if
you were all the people, from the point of view of
the whole world. You know what we mean when we
say God. We mean that whole, the whole Self. It
means seeing life from God’s point of view. It is
as if we were spectator and also actor; doing our
own little part in our own little lives, and yet seeing
the whole, and caring most for that whole, and acting
our part in relation to it, to please the vast spectator.
Have you not yourselves had that experience? Have
you not, even in exciting moments, suddenly felt as
if you were outside yourself, looking on at yourself,
and judging?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marian, “I often do. Sometimes I
laugh at myself. I see how foolish I am, but I go
right on. For the actor and the spectator do not
always agree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “All goodness and power in life spring
from making the actor and spectator agree, making
the larger self include and manage the smaller self,
and move it as a player moves a pawn. For, remember,
it is not two separate selves, but one self, a vast
sense of all life, inclusive of this smaller self which
we control. Do you not realize that all heroism, all
great and noble action is done so, in the spirit of the
whole, for the vast spectator within us? When a
man dies for a cause, he is that cause, he is far more
than his own small self, and he gladly dies for that
which includes and fulfils him. When a man gives
up his life to save another man, he sees the whole
thing as from above. He and the other man are
one, are part of the same life, and he spends himself
for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear,” I said, “cowardice, loss of self-control in
crises, always comes when the actor forgets the spectator,
when the spectator loses control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If ever you have been in any exciting crisis, and
kept cool and above fear, then you will know what I
mean; how you think of the whole, of all the people,
and seem to be and control the whole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said she knew one never thought especially
of one’s self at such a time. Experiences, however,
were scarce. Virginia spoke of the time she was with
me in a burning trolley car, and how she had been
interested rather than excited. But then she was a
very, very little girl. Ruth said she didn’t remember
how she felt when she was almost run down by an
automobile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian asked: “One is not always conscious of
the spectator?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “one is conscious of him only
at rare moments. For it is the actor who acts and
lives, and the spectator controls him. The spectator
is oftenest silent. He watches. And he must choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is the <a id='spec'></a>spectator always sure?” asked Marian.
“Sometimes you cannot tell what seems to you best,
until you talk it over with others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The spectator,” I said, “judges and chooses according
to all he can know. Surely, he chooses in relation
with others. He can use all experience; he
goes even beyond his sorrow and pain. Do you
understand? He goes beyond sorrow and pain, and
uses them. Do you remember I spoke to you once
of all things being a memory, of the body itself being
a memory? The basis of all sympathy is experience
and memory. So the spectator grows and uses everything.
He is, as it were, in partnership with the
whole, with God. And he rises on his own knowledge.
The higher he goes, the farther can he see.
Do you understand that aloofness, the judging from
the standpoint of the whole, of the whole self, is
the basis of morality? It is the part judging and
living for the whole. Those who know this make
the laws for all, according to their knowledge; and
the others, who are only actors, whose spectator is
not wide awake, have to obey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first they protested. Was this true? They did
not understand. Henry asked did I mean making
laws to control anarchists? I explained how some
had to be forced to conform, even for their own
good, and how the others were free, because the law
that was good for all, they knew to be best for themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “My own limited personal life is my
weapon and means, the only weapon and means I
have to come to completeness. I will always remember
that it is a means, something to use; but it is my
only means, and for that reason it is important and
precious to me above all else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean,” said Virginia, “that you don’t want
to dream away your life, like the ascetics of the middle
ages, who dreamed of the whole, but didn’t do
their part?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “exactly. It is as if we were all
watching a vast chessboard, all together interested in
the game, but each able to control only one pawn,
and yet anxious to play in such a way as to win the
game along with the others, each for the sake of the
whole. And that pawn is our own life; the only
power we have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t we ourselves the pawns?” asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Henry; “then we couldn’t manage
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are both pawn and player,” I said; “for if we
were only the pawn, in the crowd of little players,
we could not see ahead, and would go blindly forward
without aim. One must be above the board to
see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now I asked: “Shall we look once more over
all we have said in these few months?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They answered that it seemed to them this last
meeting had been a review.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “aloofness, which a while ago
you could not understand, is now wholly clear to you;
and more than that, it includes all we have said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t include it all,” said Henry, “but it finishes
and rounds it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And our little club is finished,” I asked, “artistically
finished?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have noticed that sometimes some of you call
it ‘class.’ Is it a class? Is it not rather a club;
have we not all gone forward together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth answered: “It is each or both. Sometimes
we speak of it as class, or club, or lesson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely it is a lesson,” said Henry, “because we
have learned something from it. Whatever you learn
from is a lesson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, after all, I suppose I have given them my
thought; and that is what I must have meant to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked them what practical result the ideas had
had upon their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean in action?” asked Marian. “I never
stop to think of it when I act, but I find that I refer
my thoughts again and again to this standard, when I
don’t mean to, or expect to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a habit of thought,” I answered, “and our
habits of thought unconsciously make our actions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Virginia, “things that happen are always
bringing to mind the things we speak of here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we have not yet reached an absolute, stiff
conclusion, have we?” insisted Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered; “we are going to be seekers all
our lives—are we not?—comrades in the search for
light?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” I went on, “I want something more of
you. I have noticed that you all are very shy about
talking of the club to outsiders. But it seems to me
that it is worth while telling your thought and your
truth, that you must not only seek, but share what
you find.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean,” said Virginia, “that we should try
to get converts, like the Catholics?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “converts to seeking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very hard,” Ruth said, “to talk to outsiders
of these things. I can tell my mother. She understands.
But we have made a language of our own
at the club, and other people don’t understand it.
When I begin to tell them, they ask: ‘What sort of
language are you using?’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a pity,” I answered, “and yet we could
hardly help it. Perhaps we should have tried to use
other words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Ruth, “I think it is a very beautiful
language, and we must use it. But it makes it hard
to tell others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People don’t want to understand,” said Henry.
“When you begin to tell them what it is about, they
make up their minds they won’t understand such
things. They set out with that idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “I often speak of certain things we
discussed, just as the other day I was speaking of
women’s professions and social life. But it is impossible
to tell the whole idea. One would have to
begin at the beginning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “it would be a whole course.
So you have to content yourself with telling the unessential
parts. But I hope that you will absorb this
idea into your life and your actions, and then find
new words in which to tell the same truth almost unconsciously,
words that will be made clear to all
through your own experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We see clearly how each one of us will draw
strength and judgment from his limitless whole self.
And the knowledge of our greatest desire will make
us teach our lesser desires to follow it, will make
us shape and use the whole of our life for the thing
we want and love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now I wish to ask you each a question. What
particular thing or power seems most dear and necessary
to you in your own life, in order to fulfil your
aim. Alfred, tell me. Do you know? Or do you
want time to think of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I want most,” said Alfred, “is the power
to calculate and judge how things are going to turn
out. To plan well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I want most,” said Marian, “is to be the
sort of girl I wish to be. To be like my idea of
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I want most,” said Virginia, “is to have
fun, to be happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does that mean?” asked Henry. “Happiness,
for each one of us, is having what we want
most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Virginia, “I like life to be pleasant
for me and for all the people about me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I want most,” said Florence, “is to be
loved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only to be loved, or to love, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be loved and to love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said: “That is what I want most, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry said: “I agree with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all seemed to wish they had said it. Virginia
added: “If you are happy, you are loved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lately,” said I, “this last week, a leader of clubs
told me he had asked this same question of a club
of boys. I wanted to see what you would answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did they answer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They, all but one, answered ‘Money.’ The one
said he wished to make beautiful things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a fine answer,” Virginia said. “I’m sure
I would like him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Henry, “a great many boys feel
that way. I happen to know of that club. One of
those boys said to me lately, what he wanted most
was to have lots of money, so he could enjoy himself.
But I think after he had the money, he would not
find the enjoyment satisfying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” I answered, “money is necessary to
life; that is, the means of life are necessary to life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But one can earn those,” said they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian said: “If I were as strong, capable and
good as I would like, and just the sort of person I
mean to be, it would be easy to earn money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth said: “If one is loved and loves many people,
one is sure to find some way of getting enough
money to live. I don’t mean that people will thrust
it on you, but you are sure to find the way to get
whatever you need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Money is only, as it were, a certificate
of power; for so much work, you are given the
means to go on working and living. But the great
problem is to make the work itself worth more to
us than the payment. And I am afraid with most
people it is not so. Money is a means for work, for
life, for fulfilment. If things were properly adjusted,
and society perfect, each man would work for
his livelihood at the work which he loved most to
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia said: “I would rather be a pauper than
not be an artist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered: “I hope each one of you will find the
means to do the work you love, and make it your
livelihood. For that is the only way to justify both
work and wage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I said: “Before we part and plan to meet
again, I am going to tell you something very exciting.
I am almost afraid to say it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? Tell us, quick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember, I told you I was keeping minutes
of the club?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that is why you wanted our papers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they are not ordinary minutes. They are
an exact account of all we have done and said.” And
then I told them of this book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were delighted. “We are all going to be
put into a book,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I answered, “it will be a book, and you are
all to be in it. But who knows whether any one else
will care? Perhaps it will never be published.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even if it isn’t published,” said Henry, “it will
be a book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will it be called?” they asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘The Seekers,’ of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to call it ‘The Pathfinder,’” said
Henry. “That would sound more romantic and interesting,
and attract people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would I dedicate it to them? they asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, certainly not,” I said; “you are all helping me
write it. We will dedicate it to all Seekers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What names would I use? they asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would use their right first names, I said. Weren’t
they willing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, yes, they were willing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For,” I said, “one could scarcely make up prettier
names: I like them all, Marian, Ruth, Florence, Virginia,
Henry and Alfred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Marian, “we like our own
names.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you have really helped me to write it,” I
said, “for I have all your papers. That’s why I
wanted them, to prove that I was not inventing the
whole thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you putting them in just as we wrote them?”
asked Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, exactly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please,” she begged, “correct my spelling and
my bad construction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will correct your spelling and your punctuation,
but nothing else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please,” she said, “change the places where
I repeated myself. I wrote them so hastily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” I said, “that what was good enough
for me will be good enough for any one. Don’t you
think so? I always wanted to write a book like
this, and as I didn’t have brains enough to invent
it alone, I made you help me. It is a real live book.
We have lived it together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now they asked me crowds of questions. Had I
put in all the nonsense? Yes, every bit. “Then we
will laugh at ourselves,” said Marian. Had I put
in every time Virginia mentioned animals? Yes, almost
every time. It must be very interesting, they
said. “Did you write down every time we laughed?”
No, I took that for granted. And did I write down
when Florence said brother Arthur told her things?
Yes. And would I leave that in? Certainly. And
would I let them see it? Yes, as soon as possible.</p>

<div><h1><a id='appen'></a>APPENDIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The notes used by the leader at each meeting, and
slightly remodeled afterward, as experience showed
them to be faulty, are here presented, in the hope that
they may be of use in some other club. Certain clubs
have been formed by some of the original Seekers,
in which the text of the book itself is being read
aloud and discussed. But were an older person leading
the club—and that is always to be desired—he
might find it far more stimulating and fruitful to conduct
the meetings by directing the conversation along
the line of these notes. No doubt if he made this
use of my experience, he would, by adding his own,
give new value to the outcome.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>NOTES</span></h2>

<h3>FIRST MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Why Are Our Religions Unsatisfying, and What Shall We Do?</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>Conditions To-day</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Religions destroy religion. If you are wrong, I
might be wrong.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Men cling to traditional, half-conscious belief,
or build up an ethic or agnostic faith, because
man must live by faith.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Historic Reasons for Present Conditions</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Initiated and popular religion in history:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. India; castes and the Brahmans.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Egypt; secret priesthood, annexed beliefs,
and interpretations of myths.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Greece; Rome; early Catholicism; the
priests.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Analysis of initiated and popular belief:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Myths of Orpheus; of Moses and the
Burning Bush; of the divine parentage of
Jesus.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. The initiated is the religion of poetry and
prophecy, of symbols. These, taken literally
by the people, become a religion of
idols and prose. One is a moving spirit,
the other a graven image. Words can be
idols.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> The modern trend:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Democratic spirit (since Reformation) destroys
initiated religion, keeps popular religion.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Science destroys popular myths.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>What Must We Do To-day?</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Scientific knowledge destroys popular myths,
but does not replace religion:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Every scientist has a philosophy or faith.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Science fosters new popular delusions, built
on its literal facts, such as atheism and
scientific superstitions of half-knowledge.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> There is absolute religious knowledge:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Its record in history: Moses, Jesus, etc.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Its testimony in our own selves:</p>

<p class='line'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(What do we <span class='it'>know</span>?)</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> In a democracy every one must attain this knowledge;
each must be initiated; every man shall be
a prophet.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>IV. <span class='sc'>What Does Each One Believe Concerning God?</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>(Question for next week.)</p>

<h3>SECOND MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>God, and the Meaning of Progress</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>The Idea of God a Personal Conviction</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> A realization to be achieved, but, after that,
silence on the subject. Sacredness of the word.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Members’ individual ideas of God.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> My idea stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. God as Self (read from Vedas), as the
completion of myself. “I am that I am.”</p>

<p class='hang'>2. The aspiration toward complete sympathy,
consciousness (selfhood) as the aspiration
of God, and the aim of progress.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. The idea of “holiness” meaning “wholeness.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Historic Ideas of God</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> The inner meaning of polytheism: many aspects
of one God.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> The inner meaning of trinity: the three as one,
as the contrast of life, and its unity. A true
paradox. Myself, the other Self, and love, the
holy spirit.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> The inner meaning of dualism: the two are two
sides of one thing, the negative and the positive.
Light makes darkness.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>d.</span> Personal, parental, and all other ideas of God
are included in our larger view. The unity embraces
all ideas and diversities.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>Progress As the Trend Toward Complete Self</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Throughout history the only progress has been
toward greater understanding and brotherhood:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The value of railroads, telephones, etc.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> The good is whatever leads toward understanding,
sympathy, wholeness.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> The bad is whatever does not lead thither:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The bad is what was once good, and has
been passed.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Or sometimes it is the necessary result of
an experimental progress.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Things are not “good” and “bad,” but better
and worse. Therefore evil itself is
proof of progress.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>d.</span> The will toward good is in the world and ourselves.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Dissatisfaction is the will toward progress.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. We use all bad things for the great good
that we love.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>(This meeting might be divided into two, one on
<span style='font-size:smaller'>GOD</span>, and one on <span style='font-size:smaller'>PROGRESS</span>.)</p>

</div>

<h3>THIRD MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Matter and Spirit</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>Short Review</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> What is the aim of life?</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> How do you explain good and bad?</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Are Matter and Spirit Antagonistic, or Like Good and Bad, to be Explained Through Each Other?</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> All matter has shape or idea:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Matter takes the shape of spirit.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. We know only the spirit, or idea, because
all things come to us through our senses.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Pure matter, if it exist, is a thing we cannot
experience.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>Matter is the Medium Through Which Spirit Expresses Itself</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Expression is the means for reaching understanding.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> All expression, at present, is through so-called
material means.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>IV. <span class='sc'>Spirit Can Do All Things in the Future</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> “Immovable” physical conditions are the result
of will or spirit in the past.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Our ancestors.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. The mental beginnings of all physical ills.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Spirit force is the only shaping force in a universe
of spirit or will.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. One can, therefore, control the physical.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. One can shape one’s destiny.</p>

</div>

</div>

<h3>FOURTH MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Evolution</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>The Place of Evolution in a Religious Enquiry</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> We must believe in that, or in special creation.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Every religion has a theory of creation.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Evolution is a theory of creation.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> It may throw light on the means of progress.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Evolution Means Descent of All Creatures from a Common One-celled Ancestral Form</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Physical proof of the theory:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. In likeness of structure.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. In rudimentary organs.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. In geological records.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. In the Law of Recapitulation.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>Theories of the Process of Evolution</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Natural Selection:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Variations in all directions, and adaptation.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Adaptation a struggle for life.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. For place.</p>

<p class='hang'>β. For food.</p>

<p class='hang'>γ. For protection, through imitative color
or form.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>3. The value of artificial selection as partly
showing us the processes of natural selection.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. What natural selection fails to explain.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> The theory of Sexual Selection, and its shortcomings.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> The auxiliary theory of Isolation.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>IV. <span class='sc'>The Philosophical Significance of Evolution</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Evolution a self-evolving of uncreated life.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Wish, desire, love cause all change and
creation.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Progress is from within, of our own will.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Change or re-birth necessitates death.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. Death makes room for young.</p>

<p class='hang'>β. We die for the sake of life.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Evolution and the aim of life:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Fitness and harmony the test of life.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. It goes from likeness to unlikeness and
recognition.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Pain, disease, death and changing standards
of good and bad are the path of progress
toward wholeness and understanding.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Evolution the simplest, clearest proof of relationship.</p>

<p class='hang'>[Note.—For reference and illustrations, the first volume
of Romanes’ “Darwin and After Darwin”
is more convenient to use and show
than Darwin’s own works.]</p>

</div>

<h3>FIFTH MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Prayer</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>A Communion, Not a Begging</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> In a world that goes toward its own desire—which
is also ours—it is folly to ask one’s vast
Self for anything.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Prayer is a momentary consciousness of the vast
Self which is God.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>The Value of Prayer</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> To be conscious, by an effort, of the vast oneness,
gives us renewed calmness and strength.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> To pray for what we can be is to call forth the
power to <span class='it'>be</span> it.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Prayer puts us in a state of mind in which we
draw upon the endless source of power and
possibility:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The value, therefore, of prayer before
sleep.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>The Manner of Prayer</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> By conscious words that give the communion.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> By an occasional state of mind.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> By every creative action.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>d.</span> By the whole attitude of our life.</p>

</div>

<h3>SIXTH MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Immortality</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>Importance to Us of an Opinion Concerning Death and Immortality</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> We know we must die soon:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Speak of the numberless generations of
life.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> We live according to our expectations:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Relation throughout history of beliefs concerning
immortality and of the morality
of peoples.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Good and bad effects of belief in heaven
and hell.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Knowledge Concerning Immortality</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> What is Knowledge?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The relativity of all knowledge.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Knowledge through conviction loses force
when there is disagreement.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Knowledge through analogy is like circumstantial
evidence.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> We know:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. That matter and force do not die.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. We know of nothing that is positively
mortal.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>2. That life works in a certain direction.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. That death and re-birth are the means of
moving in that direction, <span class='it'>i.e.</span>, of progress.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. That this progress is of the spirit or self.</p>

<p class='hang'>5. That we are forever a part of the world,
related to the whole.</p>

<p class='hang'>6. As we know nothing but consciousness or
self, we believe it must be immortal, though
we have no proof.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>The Theory of Race-immortality as an Ideal</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> It is more improbable than self-immortality.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. All planets die.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. The last generation, dies, too.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> It is not true immortality:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The thing we cannot transmit is the Self
which loves and seeks.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>IV. <span class='sc'>Memory and Personality</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Admission of ignorance and indifference. Why?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Everything is a memory and a prophecy,
since everything exists forever, and advances.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. The body is a memory.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Memory must continue at least in its results
on the self, if not more definitely.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Love and Meeting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Love may have other satisfactions than we
dream of.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. We are all one, and cannot be separated.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>V. <span class='sc'>“I Am” Expresses Immortality</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Each least thing is eternal and universal.</p>

</div>

<h3>SEVENTH MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>The Meaning of Beauty</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>Beauty is the Symbol of Completeness and Harmony</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> This is the reason beauty delights us:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. It pictures the aim and desire of our whole
life.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> The smallest thing can be as a universe in itself,
if it be complete and harmonious, <span class='it'>i.e.</span>, perfect:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. A drop as well as a planet; a dog, in his
way, as well as a man; a day as well as a
century.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>The Good, the True and the Beautiful Have the Same End, and Are Sought, Respectively, by Philosophy, Science and Art</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Philosophy seeks the whole at once, therefore
can never reach that completeness.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Science seeks individual truths, not the moral
truth, or aim:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Darwin, the philosophical scientist.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Art gives us that completeness, our aim, symbolized
in a small and definite shape.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>Genius is the Common Human Quality, Distinct from Talent</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> The Genius differs not in <span class='it'>kind</span>, but in <span class='it'>degree</span>,
from his fellows.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> The desire for understanding and completeness,
present in some measure in all, is genius.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> The understanding in the spectator is akin to
the genius in the artist.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>IV. <span class='sc'>Talent is the Power of Expression</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> To see all things as distinct wholes, impersonally.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> The skill to portray, and to handle material.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Genius and talent vary in degrees of relation in
different artists’ work:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The great idea, imperfectly executed.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. The small idea in perfect form.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>V. <span class='sc'>Art as the Symbol of Completeness and Creative Expression</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> The sublime lie of the Symbol, truer than fact:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The effect of removal from life, of unreality,
in relation to beauty. It seems
more self-sufficient.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> A complete vision must not take sides:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. When art is partisan, <span class='it'>for</span> something, it is
also <span class='it'>against</span> something. Complete representation.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Creative art gives us the joy of play, of creation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Play—interplay—is the progress and will
of life, and work but a name for the disagreeable
but necessary part of the game.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Art (creation) is the service of religion.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Laws of beauty (completeness) may give us
laws for life.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Will prepare us to deal more sanely and surely
with the involved problems of conduct.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Art in the Novel</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Completeness in the story:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Exclusion of unimportant and irrelevant
matter.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. The “story-teller” in us all.</p>

<p class='hang'>β. The distractions of real life, with its
far-relatedness.</p>

<p class='hang'>γ. The “outside” event in melodrama too
like life.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>2. Exclusion of author’s one-sided moral verdict.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Must not be “<span class='it'>for</span>” some characters, and
“<span class='it'>against</span>” others.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Understanding of Life in novel:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. False simplicity of poetic justice, of all
good, and all bad.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Cant phrases offend because they appear
imitative, not sincere.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Psychological and dramatic treatment:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. Dramatic writer trusts reader’s insight.</p>

<p class='hang'>β. Action is more convincing than description
of motive.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>4. Humor and wit:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. Humor is knowledge of human nature,
its contrasted greatness and littleness.</p>

<p class='hang'>β. Wit is a juggling of words into contrasted
or incongruous effects.</p>

<p class='hang'>γ. Both are a bringing together of the incongruous,
in a paradox of unity.</p>

<h3>NINTH MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Art</span> (Continued)</p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>Art in Poetry</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Difference between Poetry and Prose:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Poetry is “set to music,” and the rhythm
carries part of the message.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. This unreality or distance from life makes
it more complete and beautiful in itself.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. The emotions and imagination picture completeness
more easily than the intellect:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. Because the desire for completeness is
a feeling.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Completeness and understanding in Poetry:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Metaphor and simile a relationing of far-off
things.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Symbol in Play replaces them:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. The Fairy-story.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>3. Taking sides destroys poetry.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. Exaggerated and conventional phrases are
weak because they are insincere.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Art in Music</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Music is itself harmony and completeness:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The most intangible and removed, it is yet
the most satisfying symbol of completeness
and harmony.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>The Opera</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Its attempt to combine all the Arts in one harmonious
expression.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>IV. <span class='sc'>Art in Painting</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Unity or completeness in painting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Point of interest; with radiating lines, balance,
and other means of making it prominent.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. The cycle of colors, complete color, and the
contrast of light and darkness.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. A story, not embodied in the picture itself,
but needing words of explanation, spoils
unity.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. Unnecessary detail, detracting from central
interest and motive, also spoils unity.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Truth in painting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Falseness of photographic truth, because of
its lack of unity and purpose.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. The “out-of-focus” and imaginatively
planned photograph sometimes artistic.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>2. Perspective, the painter’s vision of the
single complete experience.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. To see beauty in things is to see the truth.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. “Prettiness,” the result of catering to the
shortcomings of the spectator’s taste, is a
violation of the artist’s taste or sense of
completeness and truth.</p>

<p class='hang'>5. Knowledge of life (anatomy) is necessary:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. One must understand life to portray it.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>V. <span class='sc'>Sculpture</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> The Greek Drama of the visual Arts:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The unlifelikeness of the material, the removal
from life, makes it more beautiful,
and a truer symbol.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Expresses idea through attitude of the human
form.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>VI. <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Like music’s, its appeal is to the emotions, without
definite sense or lifelikeness; but speaks as
life itself.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> To be complete, it must express outwardly its
inner use and meaning.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> To be sincere, or true, it must express the spirit
of land and people.</p>

<p class='hang'>[Note.—This ninth meeting might profitably be divided
into two.]</p>

</div>

<h3>TENTH MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Shall We Make an Art of Life?</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>Truth, Goodness and Beauty, but the Greatest of these is Beauty, Which Combines the Other Two</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Science is knowledge of facts.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Philosophy is vision of truth or aim.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Art is using our knowledge to create what we
seek. Action and purpose.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Art is Self-expression, Creation, Action, Relationing</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> All life, all being, is action, or self-expression.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> All power in the world is imaginative, creative
thought-power:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. All things must be imagined before they
can be known or done.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>All Great Action, All Goodness, All Power in Life Follows the Same Laws as Art</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Therefore let us discover the laws of all arts,
and see whether they can be applied to life.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>IV. <span class='sc'>The Message of All the Arts</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> All have the same laws:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Art is the symbol of completeness in a definite
shape.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Is self-expression and self-fulfilment.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Must leave out the unimportant.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. Must have variety and many-sidedness.</p>

<p class='hang'>5. Must not be partisan, and must be sympathetic.</p>

<p class='hang'>6. Must give the impression of truth.</p>

<p class='hang'>7. Must be aloof, that is, separate from life,
and see things, as it were, from a distance,
in their wholeness.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>V. <span class='sc'>Review and Conclusion</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Each smallest thing can symbolize the whole:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Each human life is a symbol of the complete
Self, in a definite shape.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Each is deserving of reverence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. Reverence is the small self awed before
its own vastness.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>[Note.—As the eleventh meeting was somewhat
of a digression, and as the notes taken
were covered in later meetings, it is here
omitted.]</p>

</div>

<h3>TWELFTH MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>What is Goodness?</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>Each Life, to be Good or Beautiful, Must be a Symbol of that Perfect or Complete Life for Which We Long</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Life—the symbol of complete Self in a definite
shape.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> The good man makes all he knows and touches
a complete, harmonious whole:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Goodness is always of relation.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. One cannot be perfect till all are so:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. Therefore goodness implies modesty.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>False and True Good</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> The one law of Love, and its petty, changing
codes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. True good of changing harmonious relation.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. False good of outworn custom and rule.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>The Meaning of Self-expression</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> The small and large Self:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The whole world is the whole of me.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Serve, not others only, but others as part
of yourself.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Self-sacrifice:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Giving up one thing for a greater thing.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Happiness is whatever we want most.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. If completeness is the aim of life, then all
lesser happiness is sacrificed to it.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. If life is a drama, a whole, we give up our
selfish satisfaction to see that whole self
satisfied.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Creation is Self-expression, is endless, higher
rebirth:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. All action reveals the actor.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Life is a drama, in which we feel ourselves
to have equal prominence with others, and
conscious power of control:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. We cannot help having influence.</p>

<p class='hang'>β. Let us shape our influence for the
whole.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<h3>THIRTEENTH MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Self-fulfilment Through Overcoming Limitations</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>Envy, Its Narrowness and Blindness</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Every man serves me who does for me what I
cannot do for myself:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Each one fills out my shortcomings.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Use, instead of coveting.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Self-regulation in Despite of Self</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> The moral sense of beauty, an intellectual sense
of completeness, makes us regulate and suppress
our desires:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Hence we make laws which are substitutes
for understanding love.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> The substitutes necessary until love conquers,
are:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Justice.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Honesty.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Duty.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. Binding by promise.</p>

<p class='hang'>5. Obedience.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Conventions, their changes and their convenience.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>Some Virtues Changed by Love’s Demands</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Revenge, the first expression of Loyalty:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Our admiration for such expression in its
own early time.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Pity, the developer of Feeling:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Degenerates into Weakness and Impotence.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Is an Insult:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. A strong man does not pity himself.
Should not pity other strong selves.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>3. Strong Sympathy, and our common Working
for the great Happiness, should replace
pity.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Reverence for special people, with Fear:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Self-reverence means reverence for all
selves.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Reverence the old—and the young, too.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. The reverence with love replaces the reverence
with fear.</p>

</div>

</div>

<h3>FOURTEENTH MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Loyalty, and Conscious Allegiance to our Individual Aspiration</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>Patriotism; its Meaning</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> We are children of all we can love and serve:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The growth of loyalty, from the family
to the world:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. War as a fighting for peace.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Patriotism in its growth, like all progress, must
include the small in the large, though in seeming
disloyalty:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Disloyalty to one’s country cannot be loyalty
to the world.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. But wholesome criticism often seems disloyal:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. The loyalty of revolutionists.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Conscious Choice in Self-development</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Know what you want most to be.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Eliminate whatever interferes with your choice;
make life a work of art, not a haphazard photograph.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Concentration.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Choose and subordinate your studies for
their worth to you.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Prefer friends to acquaintances.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. Do the work at hand (charity at home),
and be sure your service harmonizes with
your knowledge and your whole life.</p>

<p class='hang'>5. Never degrade the end by making an <span class='it'>end</span>
out of the <span class='it'>means</span>. (Business, athletics,
study, must always be means.)</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> Dare to desire the utmost, unflinchingly:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Greatness comes from persistent desire
rather than from inborn skill.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>d.</span> Youth and old age:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Desire and service can continue throughout
life.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>Variety and Rhythm</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Varied life with single Aim:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Concentrate on one thing at a time, but not
on one thing all the time.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. The meaning and worth of Knowledge.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Never be bored, or bore:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. Sense of humor; and use of silence.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>4. Work and play, exertion and rest, must
harmonize:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. Even your pleasures will reflect your
character, or taste.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Be a rhythm, a measure, a force like music in
the life all about you.</p>

<p class='hang'>[Note.—The fifteenth meeting was spent on Christian
Science, and is therefore omitted from
the notes.]</p>

<h3>SIXTEENTH MEETING</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Social Relations</span></p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>The Avoidance of Bitter Partisanship</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Take sides, not with persons, but with causes.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Use all. Be for all, and against none.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>II. <span class='sc'>Social Sympathy</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Humanity as a vast Self:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Democracy means we have all the right to
be equal:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. Faith and reverence for self in all.</p>

<p class='hang'>β. Service is larger self-service.</p>

<p class='hang'>γ. Each does his part; hand and head.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'>2. To keep well, to be satisfied, we must care
for the sick and miserable:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>α. Starvation.</p>

<p class='hang'>β. Old age.</p>

<p class='hang'>γ. Contagion.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> To care for the weak strengthens the strong:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. To destroy the weak is dangerous loss.
(Rome and Sparta.)</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>c.</span> In passing judgment on crimes, hate not persons
but their acts:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Each acts according to his desire or needs.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Punishment as preventive and cure.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>III. <span class='sc'>Truth in Personal Relations</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> Truth-telling not the whole of Truth:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Malicious truth-telling is not truth.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Worth of kind, true criticism and praise.</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> Our judgments of people judge us:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Our limited understanding.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Say: “I am one who hates, or loves,” etc.</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. The morality of good manners.</p>

worth or loveableness.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. “Prettiness” in manner, pleasing those who
cannot understand us.</p>

<p class='hang'>I. <span class='sc'>Seeing Life as a Spectator, from God’s Point of View</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>a.</span> The collective personality:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>1. Psychological fact: We are often outside
ourselves in tense moments.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Getting far away from oneself in self-criticism
and judgment.</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Our reasonableness in crises.</p>

<p class='hang'>4. All heroism is self-forgetfulness for the
sake of the whole.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

part of whole.</p>

<p class='hang'>2. We can get above our own sorrow and
pain, and use them.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>b.</span> This aloofness from self, or being the <span class='it'>One</span>, is
the root of all morals:</p>

<p class='hang'>1. Some know this, and make laws; the others
are forced to obey.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Dr. Gregory B. Newby
    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
